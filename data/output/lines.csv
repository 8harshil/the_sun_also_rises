89,Robert Cohn was once middleweight boxing champion of Princeton. Do not,70,1
90,"think that I am very much impressed by that as a boxing title, but it",69,1
91,"meant a lot to Cohn. He cared nothing for boxing, in fact he disliked",69,1
92,"it, but he learned it painfully and thoroughly to counteract the feeling",72,1
93,of inferiority and shyness he had felt on being treated as a Jew at,67,1
94,Princeton. There was a certain inner comfort in knowing he could knock,70,1
95,"down anybody who was snooty to him, although, being very shy and a",66,1
96,"thoroughly nice boy, he never fought except in the gym. He was Spider",69,1
97,Kelly’s star pupil. Spider Kelly taught all his young gentlemen to box,70,1
98,"like featherweights, no matter whether they weighed one hundred and five",72,1
99,or two hundred and five pounds. But it seemed to fit Cohn. He was really,72,1
100,very fast. He was so good that Spider promptly overmatched him and got,70,1
101,his nose permanently flattened. This increased Cohn’s distaste for,66,1
102,"boxing, but it gave him a certain satisfaction of some strange sort, and",72,1
103,it certainly improved his nose. In his last year at Princeton he read,69,1
104,too much and took to wearing spectacles. I never met any one of his,67,1
105,class who remembered him. They did not even remember that he was,64,1
106,middleweight boxing champion.,29,1
107,,0,1
108,"I mistrust all frank and simple people, especially when their stories",69,1
109,"hold together, and I always had a suspicion that perhaps Robert Cohn had",72,1
110,"never been middleweight boxing champion, and that perhaps a horse had",69,1
111,"stepped on his face, or that maybe his mother had been frightened or",68,1
112,"seen something, or that he had, maybe, bumped into something as a young",71,1
113,"child, but I finally had somebody verify the story from Spider Kelly.",69,1
114,Spider Kelly not only remembered Cohn. He had often wondered what had,69,1
115,become of him.,14,1
116,,0,1
117,"Robert Cohn was a member, through his father, of one of the richest",67,1
118,"Jewish families in New York, and through his mother of one of the",65,1
119,"oldest. At the military school where he prepped for Princeton, and",66,1
120,"played a very good end on the football team, no one had made him",64,1
121,"race-conscious. No one had ever made him feel he was a Jew, and hence",69,1
122,"any different from anybody else, until he went to Princeton. He was a",69,1
123,"nice boy, a friendly boy, and very shy, and it made him bitter. He took",71,1
124,"it out in boxing, and he came out of Princeton with painful",59,1
125,"self-consciousness and the flattened nose, and was married by the first",71,1
126,"girl who was nice to him. He was married five years, had three children,",72,1
127,"lost most of the fifty thousand dollars his father left him, the balance",72,1
128,"of the estate having gone to his mother, hardened into a rather",63,1
129,unattractive mould under domestic unhappiness with a rich wife; and just,72,1
130,when he had made up his mind to leave his wife she left him and went off,72,1
131,with a miniature-painter. As he had been thinking for months about,66,1
132,leaving his wife and had not done it because it would be too cruel to,69,1
133,"deprive her of himself, her departure was a very healthful shock.",65,1
134,,0,1
135,The divorce was arranged and Robert Cohn went out to the Coast. In,66,1
136,"California he fell among literary people and, as he still had a little",70,1
137,"of the fifty thousand left, in a short time he was backing a review of",70,1
138,"the Arts. The review commenced publication in Carmel, California, and",69,1
139,"finished in Provincetown, Massachusetts. By that time Cohn, who had been",72,1
140,"regarded purely as an angel, and whose name had appeared on the",63,1
141,"editorial page merely as a member of the advisory board, had become the",71,1
142,sole editor. It was his money and he discovered he liked the authority,70,1
143,of editing. He was sorry when the magazine became too expensive and he,70,1
144,had to give it up.,18,1
145,,0,1
146,"By that time, though, he had other things to worry about. He had been",69,1
147,taken in hand by a lady who hoped to rise with the magazine. She was,68,1
148,"very forceful, and Cohn never had a chance of not being taken in hand.",70,1
149,Also he was sure that he loved her. When this lady saw that the magazine,72,1
150,"was not going to rise, she became a little disgusted with Cohn and",66,1
151,decided that she might as well get what there was to get while there was,72,1
152,"still something available, so she urged that they go to Europe, where",69,1
153,"Cohn could write. They came to Europe, where the lady had been educated,",72,1
154,"and stayed three years. During these three years, the first spent in",68,1
155,"travel, the last two in Paris, Robert Cohn had two friends, Braddocks",69,1
156,and myself. Braddocks was his literary friend. I was his tennis friend.,71,1
157,,0,1
158,"The lady who had him, her name was Frances, found toward the end of the",71,1
159,"second year that her looks were going, and her attitude toward Robert",69,1
160,changed from one of careless possession and exploitation to the absolute,72,1
161,determination that he should marry her. During this time Robert’s mother,72,1
162,"had settled an allowance on him, about three hundred dollars a month.",69,1
163,During two years and a half I do not believe that Robert Cohn looked at,71,1
164,"another woman. He was fairly happy, except that, like many people living",72,1
165,"in Europe, he would rather have been in America, and he had discovered",70,1
166,"writing. He wrote a novel, and it was not really such a bad novel as the",72,1
167,"critics later called it, although it was a very poor novel. He read many",72,1
168,"books, played bridge, played tennis, and boxed at a local gymnasium.",68,1
169,,0,1
170,I first became aware of his lady’s attitude toward him one night after,70,1
171,the three of us had dined together. We had dined at l’Avenue’s and,66,1
172,afterward went to the Café de Versailles for coffee. We had several,67,1
173,"_fines_ after the coffee, and I said I must be going. Cohn had been",67,1
174,talking about the two of us going off somewhere on a weekend trip. He,69,1
175,wanted to get out of town and get in a good walk. I suggested we fly to,71,1
176,"Strasbourg and walk up to Saint Odile, or somewhere or other in Alsace.",71,1
177,"“I know a girl in Strasbourg who can show us the town,” I said.",63,1
178,,0,1
179,Somebody kicked me under the table. I thought it was accidental and went,72,1
180,on: “She’s been there two years and knows everything there is to know,69,1
181,about the town. She’s a swell girl.”,36,1
182,,0,1
183,"I was kicked again under the table and, looking, saw Frances, Robert’s",70,1
184,"lady, her chin lifting and her face hardening.",46,1
185,,0,1
186,"“Hell,” I said, “why go to Strasbourg? We could go up to Bruges, or to",70,1
187,the Ardennes.”,14,1
188,,0,1
189,Cohn looked relieved. I was not kicked again. I said good-night and went,72,1
190,out. Cohn said he wanted to buy a paper and would walk to the corner,68,1
191,"with me. “For God’s sake,” he said, “why did you say that about that",68,1
192,girl in Strasbourg for? Didn’t you see Frances?”,48,1
193,,0,1
194,"“No, why should I? If I know an American girl that lives in Strasbourg",70,1
195,what the hell is it to Frances?”,32,1

217,,0,1
218,"“You forgot to get your paper,” I said.",39,1
219,,0,1
220,“That’s so.” He walked with me up to the kiosque at the corner. “You are,72,1
221,"not sore, are you, Jake?” He turned with the paper in his hand.",63,1
222,,0,1
223,"“No, why should I be?”",22,1
224,,0,1
225,"“See you at tennis,” he said. I watched him walk back to the café",65,1
226,holding his paper. I rather liked him and evidently she led him quite a,71,1
227,life.,5,1

236,"That winter Robert Cohn went over to America with his novel, and it was",71,2
237,accepted by a fairly good publisher. His going made an awful row I,66,2
238,"heard, and I think that was where Frances lost him, because several",67,2
239,"women were nice to him in New York, and when he came back he was quite",70,2
240,"changed. He was more enthusiastic about America than ever, and he was",69,2
241,"not so simple, and he was not so nice. The publishers had praised his",69,2
242,novel pretty highly and it rather went to his head. Then several women,70,2
243,"had put themselves out to be nice to him, and his horizons had all",66,2
244,shifted. For four years his horizon had been absolutely limited to his,70,2
245,"wife. For three years, or almost three years, he had never seen beyond",70,2
246,Frances. I am sure he had never been in love in his life.,57,2
247,,0,2
248,"He had married on the rebound from the rotten time he had in college,",69,2
249,and Frances took him on the rebound from his discovery that he had not,70,2
250,been everything to his first wife. He was not in love yet but he,64,2
251,"realized that he was an attractive quantity to women, and that the fact",71,2
252,of a woman caring for him and wanting to live with him was not simply a,71,2
253,divine miracle. This changed him so that he was not so pleasant to have,71,2
254,"around. Also, playing for higher stakes than he could afford in some",68,2
255,"rather steep bridge games with his New York connections, he had held",68,2
256,cards and won several hundred dollars. It made him rather vain of his,69,2
257,"bridge game, and he talked several times of how a man could always make",71,2
258,a living at bridge if he were ever forced to.,45,2
259,,0,2
260,Then there was another thing. He had been reading W. H. Hudson. That,68,2
261,"sounds like an innocent occupation, but Cohn had read and reread “The",69,2
262,Purple Land.” “The Purple Land” is a very sinister book if read too late,72,2
263,in life. It recounts splendid imaginary amorous adventures of a perfect,71,2
264,"English gentleman in an intensely romantic land, the scenery of which is",72,2
265,very well described. For a man to take it at thirty-four as a guide-book,72,2
266,to what life holds is about as safe as it would be for a man of the same,72,2
267,"age to enter Wall Street direct from a French convent, equipped with a",70,2
268,"complete set of the more practical Alger books. Cohn, I believe, took",69,2
269,every word of “The Purple Land” as literally as though it had been an,69,2
270,"R. G. Dun report. You understand me, he made some reservations, but on",70,2
271,the whole the book to him was sound. It was all that was needed to set,70,2
272,him off. I did not realize the extent to which it had set him off until,71,2
273,one day he came into my office.,31,2

275,"“Hello, Robert,” I said. “Did you come in to cheer me up?”",58,2

349,"a drink all you had to say was: “Well, I’ve got to get back and get off",71,2

351,"exits like that in the newspaper business, where it is such an important",72,2
352,"part of the ethics that you should never seem to be working. Anyway, we",71,2

483,“Don’t you like Paris?”,23,3
484,,0,3
485,“No.”,5,3
486,,0,3
487,“Why don’t you go somewhere else?”,34,3
488,,0,3
489,“Isn’t anywhere else.”,22,3

493,"“Happy, hell!”",14,3

495,Pernod is greenish imitation absinthe. When you add water it turns,66,3
496,"milky. It tastes like licorice and it has a good uplift, but it drops",69,3
497,"you just as far. We sat and drank it, and the girl looked sullen.",65,3
498,,0,3
499,"“Well,” I said, “are you going to buy me a dinner?”",51,3
500,,0,3
501,She grinned and I saw why she made a point of not laughing. With her,68,3
502,mouth closed she was a rather pretty girl. I paid for the saucers and we,72,3
503,walked out to the street. I hailed a horse-cab and the driver pulled up,71,3
504,"at the curb. Settled back in the slow, smoothly rolling _fiacre_ we",67,3
505,"moved up the Avenue de l’Opéra, passed the locked doors of the shops,",69,3
506,"their windows lighted, the Avenue broad and shiny and almost deserted.",70,3
507,The cab passed the New York _Herald_ bureau with the window full of,67,3
508,clocks.,7,3
509,,0,3
510,“What are all the clocks for?” she asked.,41,3
511,,0,3
512,“They show the hour all over America.”,38,3
513,,0,3
514,“Don’t kid me.”,15,3
515,,0,3
516,"We turned off the Avenue up the Rue des Pyramides, through the traffic",70,3
517,"of the Rue de Rivoli, and through a dark gate into the Tuileries. She",69,3
518,cuddled against me and I put my arm around her. She looked up to be,67,3
519,kissed. She touched me with one hand and I put her hand away.,61,3
520,,0,3
521,“Never mind.”,13,3
522,,0,3
523,“What’s the matter? You sick?”,30,3
524,,0,3
525,“Yes.”,6,3
526,,0,3
527,"“Everybody’s sick. I’m sick, too.”",34,3
528,,0,3
529,We came out of the Tuileries into the light and crossed the Seine and,69,3
530,then turned up the Rue des Saints Pères.,40,3
531,,0,3
532,“You oughtn’t to drink pernod if you’re sick.”,46,3
533,,0,3
534,“You neither.”,14,3
535,,0,3
536,“It doesn’t make any difference with me. It doesn’t make any difference,71,3
537,with a woman.”,14,3
538,,0,3
539,“What are you called?”,22,3
540,,0,3
541,“Georgette. How are you called?”,32,3
542,,0,3
543,“Jacob.”,8,3
544,,0,3
545,“That’s a Flemish name.”,24,3
546,,0,3
547,“American too.”,15,3
548,,0,3
549,“You’re not Flamand?”,21,3
550,,0,3
551,"“No, American.”",15,3
552,,0,3
553,"“Good, I detest Flamands.”",26,3
554,,0,3
555,By this time we were at the restaurant. I called to the _cocher_ to,67,3
556,stop. We got out and Georgette did not like the looks of the place.,67,3
557,“This is no great thing of a restaurant.”,41,3
558,,0,3
559,"“No,” I said. “Maybe you would rather go to Foyot’s. Why don’t you keep",71,3
560,the cab and go on?”,19,3
561,,0,3
562,I had picked her up because of a vague sentimental idea that it would be,72,3
563,nice to eat with some one. It was a long time since I had dined with a,70,3
564,"_poule_, and I had forgotten how dull it could be. We went into the",67,3
565,"restaurant, passed Madame Lavigne at the desk and into a little room.",69,3
566,Georgette cheered up a little under the food.,45,3
567,,0,3
568,"“It isn’t bad here,” she said. “It isn’t chic, but the food is all",66,3
569,right.”,7,3

571,“Better than you eat in Liège.”,31,3
572,,0,3
573,"“Brussels, you mean.”",21,3
574,,0,3
575,We had another bottle of wine and Georgette made a joke. She smiled and,71,3
576,"showed all her bad teeth, and we touched glasses. “You’re not a bad",67,3
577,"type,” she said. “It’s a shame you’re sick. We get on well. What’s the",70,3
578,"matter with you, anyway?”",25,3
579,,0,3
580,"“I got hurt in the war,” I said.",32,3
581,,0,3
582,"“Oh, that dirty war.”",21,3
583,,0,3
584,We would probably have gone on and discussed the war and agreed that it,71,3
585,"was in reality a calamity for civilization, and perhaps would have been",71,3
586,better avoided. I was bored enough. Just then from the other room some,70,3
587,"one called: “Barnes! I say, Barnes! Jacob Barnes!”",50,3
588,,0,3
589,"“It’s a friend calling me,” I explained, and went out.",54,3
590,,0,3
591,"There was Braddocks at a big table with a party: Cohn, Frances Clyne,",69,3
592,"Mrs. Braddocks, several people I did not know.",46,3
593,,0,3
594,"“You’re coming to the dance, aren’t you?” Braddocks asked.",58,3
595,,0,3
596,“What dance?”,13,3
597,,0,3
598,"“Why, the dancings. Don’t you know we’ve revived them?” Mrs. Braddocks",70,3
599,put in.,7,3
600,,0,3
601,"“You must come, Jake. We’re all going,” Frances said from the end of the",72,3
602,table. She was tall and had a smile.,36,3
603,,0,3
604,"“Of course, he’s coming,” Braddocks said. “Come in and have coffee with",71,3
605,"us, Barnes.”",12,3
606,,0,3
607,“Right.”,8,3
608,,0,3
609,"“And bring your friend,” said Mrs. Braddocks laughing. She was a",64,3
610,Canadian and had all their easy social graces.,46,3
611,,0,3
612,"“Thanks, we’ll be in,” I said. I went back to the small room.",61,3
613,,0,3
614,“Who are your friends?” Georgette asked.,40,3
615,,0,3
616,“Writers and artists.”,22,3
617,,0,3
618,“There are lots of those on this side of the river.”,52,3
619,,0,3
620,“Too many.”,11,3
621,,0,3
622,"“I think so. Still, some of them make money.”",45,3
623,,0,3
624,"“Oh, yes.”",10,3
625,,0,3
626,"We finished the meal and the wine. “Come on,” I said. “We’re going to",69,3
627,have coffee with the others.”,29,3
628,,0,3
629,"Georgette opened her bag, made a few passes at her face as she looked in",72,3
630,"the little mirror, re-defined her lips with the lipstick, and",61,3
631,straightened her hat.,21,3
632,,0,3
633,"“Good,” she said.",17,3
634,,0,3
635,We went into the room full of people and Braddocks and the men at his,69,3
636,table stood up.,15,3
637,,0,3
638,"“I wish to present my fiancée, Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc,” I said.",71,3
639,"Georgette smiled that wonderful smile, and we shook hands all round.",68,3
640,,0,3
641,"“Are you related to Georgette Leblanc, the singer?” Mrs. Braddocks",66,3
642,asked.,6,3
643,,0,3
644,"“Connais pas,” Georgette answered.",34,3
645,,0,3
646,"“But you have the same name,” Mrs. Braddocks insisted cordially.",64,3
647,,0,3
648,"“No,” said Georgette. “Not at all. My name is Hobin.”",53,3
649,,0,3
650,“But Mr. Barnes introduced you as Mademoiselle Georgette Leblanc. Surely,72,3
651,"he did,” insisted Mrs. Braddocks, who in the excitement of talking",66,3
652,French was liable to have no idea what she was saying.,54,3
653,,0,3
654,"“He’s a fool,” Georgette said.",30,3
655,,0,3
656,"“Oh, it was a joke, then,” Mrs. Braddocks said.",47,3
657,,0,3
658,"“Yes,” said Georgette. “To laugh at.”",37,3
659,,0,3
660,"“Did you hear that, Henry?” Mrs. Braddocks called down the table to",67,3
661,"Braddocks. “Mr. Barnes introduced his fiancée as Mademoiselle Leblanc,",70,3
662,and her name is actually Hobin.”,32,3
663,,0,3
664,"“Of course, darling. Mademoiselle Hobin, I’ve known her for a very long",71,3
665,time.”,6,3
666,,0,3
667,"“Oh, Mademoiselle Hobin,” Frances Clyne called, speaking French very",68,3
668,rapidly and not seeming so proud and astonished as Mrs. Braddocks at its,72,3
669,coming out really French. “Have you been in Paris long? Do you like it,70,3
670,"here? You love Paris, do you not?”",34,3
671,,0,3
672,“Who’s she?” Georgette turned to me. “Do I have to talk to her?”,64,3
673,,0,3
674,"She turned to Frances, sitting smiling, her hands folded, her head",66,3
675,"poised on her long neck, her lips pursed ready to start talking again.",70,3
676,,0,3
677,"“No, I don’t like Paris. It’s expensive and dirty.”",51,3
678,,0,3
679,“Really? I find it so extraordinarily clean. One of the cleanest cities,71,3
680,in all Europe.”,15,3
681,,0,3
682,“I find it dirty.”,18,3
683,,0,3
684,“How strange! But perhaps you have not been here very long.”,60,3
685,,0,3
686,“I’ve been here long enough.”,29,3
687,,0,3
688,“But it does have nice people in it. One must grant that.”,58,3
689,,0,3
690,Georgette turned to me. “You have nice friends.”,48,3
691,,0,3
692,Frances was a little drunk and would have liked to have kept it up but,70,3
693,"the coffee came, and Lavigne with the liqueurs, and after that we all",69,3
694,went out and started for Braddocks’s dancing-club.,50,3
695,,0,3
696,The dancing-club was a _bal musette_ in the Rue de la Montagne Sainte,69,3
697,Geneviève. Five nights a week the working people of the Pantheon quarter,72,3
698,danced there. One night a week it was the dancing-club. On Monday nights,72,3
699,"it was closed. When we arrived it was quite empty, except for a",63,3
700,"policeman sitting near the door, the wife of the proprietor back of the",71,3
701,"zinc bar, and the proprietor himself. The daughter of the house came",68,3
702,"downstairs as we went in. There were long benches, and tables ran across",72,3
703,"the room, and at the far end a dancing-floor.",45,3
704,,0,3
705,"“I wish people would come earlier,” Braddocks said. The daughter came up",72,3
706,and wanted to know what we would drink. The proprietor got up on a high,71,3
707,stool beside the dancing-floor and began to play the accordion. He had a,72,3
708,string of bells around one of his ankles and beat time with his foot as,71,3
709,he played. Every one danced. It was hot and we came off the floor,65,3
710,perspiring.,11,3
711,,0,3
712,"“My God,” Georgette said. “What a box to sweat in!”",51,3
713,,0,3
714,“It’s hot.”,11,3
715,,0,3
716,"“Hot, my God!”",14,3
717,,0,3
718,“Take off your hat.”,20,3
719,,0,3
720,“That’s a good idea.”,21,3
721,,0,3
722,"Some one asked Georgette to dance, and I went over to the bar. It was",69,3
723,really very hot and the accordion music was pleasant in the hot night. I,72,3
724,"drank a beer, standing in the doorway and getting the cool breath of",68,3
725,wind from the street. Two taxis were coming down the steep street. They,71,3
726,"both stopped in front of the Bal. A crowd of young men, some in jerseys",71,3
727,"and some in their shirt-sleeves, got out. I could see their hands and",69,3
728,"newly washed, wavy hair in the light from the door. The policeman",65,3
729,standing by the door looked at me and smiled. They came in. As they went,72,3
730,"in, under the light I saw white hands, wavy hair, white faces,",62,3
731,"grimacing, gesturing, talking. With them was Brett. She looked very",67,3
732,lovely and she was very much with them.,39,3
733,,0,3
734,One of them saw Georgette and said: “I do declare. There is an actual,69,3
735,"harlot. I’m going to dance with her, Lett. You watch me.”",57,3
736,,0,3
737,"The tall dark one, called Lett, said: “Don’t you be rash.”",58,3
738,,0,3
739,"The wavy blond one answered: “Don’t you worry, dear.” And with them was",71,3
740,Brett.,6,3
741,,0,3
742,I was very angry. Somehow they always made me angry. I know they are,68,3
743,"supposed to be amusing, and you should be tolerant, but I wanted to",67,3
744,"swing on one, any one, anything to shatter that superior, simpering",67,3
745,"composure. Instead, I walked down the street and had a beer at the bar",70,3
746,at the next Bal. The beer was not good and I had a worse cognac to take,71,3
747,the taste out of my mouth. When I came back to the Bal there was a crowd,72,3
748,"on the floor and Georgette was dancing with the tall blond youth, who",69,3
749,"danced big-hippily, carrying his head on one side, his eyes lifted as he",72,3
750,danced. As soon as the music stopped another one of them asked her to,69,3
751,dance. She had been taken up by them. I knew then that they would all,69,3
752,dance with her. They are like that.,35,3
753,,0,3
754,I sat down at a table. Cohn was sitting there. Frances was dancing. Mrs.,72,3
755,Braddocks brought up somebody and introduced him as Robert Prentiss. He,71,3
756,"was from New York by way of Chicago, and was a rising new novelist. He",70,3
757,had some sort of an English accent. I asked him to have a drink.,64,3
758,,0,3
759,"“Thanks so much,” he said, “I’ve just had one.”",47,3
760,,0,3
761,“Have another.”,15,3
762,,0,3
763,"“Thanks, I will then.”",22,3
764,,0,3
765,We got the daughter of the house over and each had a _fine à l’eau_.,68,3
766,,0,3
767,"“You’re from Kansas City, they tell me,” he said.",49,3
768,,0,3
769,“Yes.”,6,3
770,,0,3
771,“Do you find Paris amusing?”,28,3
772,,0,3
773,“Yes.”,6,3
774,,0,3
775,“Really?”,9,3
776,,0,3
777,I was a little drunk. Not drunk in any positive sense but just enough to,72,3
778,be careless.,12,3
779,,0,3
780,"“For God’s sake,” I said, “yes. Don’t you?”",43,3
781,,0,3
782,"“Oh, how charmingly you get angry,” he said. “I wish I had that",63,3
783,faculty.”,9,3
784,,0,3
785,I got up and walked over toward the dancing-floor. Mrs. Braddocks,65,3
786,"followed me. “Don’t be cross with Robert,” she said. “He’s still only a",71,3
787,"child, you know.”",17,3
788,,0,3
789,"“I wasn’t cross,” I said. “I just thought perhaps I was going to throw",70,3
790,up.”,4,3
791,,0,3
792,"“Your fiancée is having a great success,” Mrs. Braddocks looked out on",70,3
793,"the floor where Georgette was dancing in the arms of the tall, dark one,",72,3
794,called Lett.,12,3
795,,0,3
796,“Isn’t she?” I said.,20,3
797,,0,3
798,"“Rather,” said Mrs. Braddocks.",30,3
799,,0,3
800,"Cohn came up. “Come on, Jake,” he said, “have a drink.” We walked over",70,3
801,to the bar. “What’s the matter with you? You seem all worked up over,68,3
802,something?”,11,3
803,,0,3
804,“Nothing. This whole show makes me sick is all.”,48,3
805,,0,3
806,Brett came up to the bar.,25,3
807,,0,3
808,"“Hello, you chaps.”",19,3
809,,0,3
810,"“Hello, Brett,” I said. “Why aren’t you tight?”",47,3
811,,0,3
812,"“Never going to get tight any more. I say, give a chap a brandy and",67,3
813,soda.”,6,3
814,,0,3
815,She stood holding the glass and I saw Robert Cohn looking at her. He,68,3
816,looked a great deal as his compatriot must have looked when he saw the,70,3
817,"promised land. Cohn, of course, was much younger. But he had that look",70,3
818,"of eager, deserving expectation.",32,3
819,,0,3
820,Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a,71,3
821,"tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy’s. She started all",72,3
822,"that. She was built with curves like the hull of a racing yacht, and you",72,3
823,missed none of it with that wool jersey.,40,3
824,,0,3
825,"“It’s a fine crowd you’re with, Brett,” I said.",47,3
826,,0,3
827,"“Aren’t they lovely? And you, my dear. Where did you get it?”",61,3
828,,0,3
829,“At the Napolitain.”,20,3
830,,0,3
831,“And have you had a lovely evening?”,36,3
832,,0,3
833,"“Oh, priceless,” I said.",24,3
834,,0,3
835,"Brett laughed. “It’s wrong of you, Jake. It’s an insult to all of us.",69,3
836,"Look at Frances there, and Jo.”",31,3
837,,0,3
838,This for Cohn’s benefit.,24,3
839,,0,3
840,"“It’s in restraint of trade,” Brett said. She laughed again.",60,3
841,,0,3
842,"“You’re wonderfully sober,” I said.",35,3
843,,0,3
844,"“Yes. Aren’t I? And when one’s with the crowd I’m with, one can drink in",72,3
845,"such safety, too.”",18,3
846,,0,3
847,"The music started and Robert Cohn said: “Will you dance this with me,",69,3
848,Lady Brett?”,12,3
849,,0,3
850,"Brett smiled at him. “I’ve promised to dance this with Jacob,” she",66,3

852,,0,3
853,“How about the next?” asked Cohn.,33,3
854,,0,3
855,"“We’re going,” Brett said. “We’ve a date up at Montmartre.” Dancing, I",70,3
856,"looked over Brett’s shoulder and saw Cohn, standing at the bar, still",69,3
857,watching her.,13,3
858,,0,3
859,"“You’ve made a new one there,” I said to her.",45,3

861,“Don’t talk about it. Poor chap. I never knew it till just now.”,64,3
862,,0,3
863,"“Oh, well,” I said. “I suppose you like to add them up.”",56,3
864,,0,3
865,“Don’t talk like a fool.”,25,3

867,“You do.”,9,3
868,,0,3
869,"“Oh, well. What if I do?”",25,3
870,,0,3
871,"“Nothing,” I said. We were dancing to the accordion and some one was",68,3
872,playing the banjo. It was hot and I felt happy. We passed close to,66,3
873,Georgette dancing with another one of them.,43,3
874,,0,3
875,“What possessed you to bring her?”,34,3
876,,0,3

890,,0,3
891,“Would I ask you if I didn’t want to?”,38,3
892,,0,3
893,We left the floor and I took my coat off a hanger on the wall and put it,72,3
894,on. Brett stood by the bar. Cohn was talking to her. I stopped at the,69,3
895,bar and asked them for an envelope. The patronne found one. I took a,68,3
896,"fifty-franc note from my pocket, put it in the envelope, sealed it, and",71,3
897,handed it to the patronne.,26,3
898,,0,3
899,"“If the girl I came with asks for me, will you give her this?” I said.",70,3

905,"“Yes,” I said.",14,3
906,,0,3
907,We started out the door. Cohn was still talking to Brett. She said good,71,3

909,we looked for a taxi.,21,3

911,"“You’re going to lose your fifty francs,” Brett said.",53,3
912,,0,3
913,"“Oh, yes.”",10,3
914,,0,3
915,“No taxis.”,11,3
916,,0,3
917,“We could walk up to the Pantheon and get one.”,47,3
918,,0,3
919,“Come on and we’ll get a drink in the pub next door and send for one.”,70,3
920,,0,3
921,“You wouldn’t walk across the street.”,38,3
922,,0,3
923,“Not if I could help it.”,25,3
924,,0,3
925,We went into the next bar and I sent a waiter for a taxi.,57,3
926,,0,3
927,"“Well,” I said, “we’re out away from them.”",43,3
928,,0,3
929,We stood against the tall zinc bar and did not talk and looked at each,70,3
930,other. The waiter came and said the taxi was outside. Brett pressed my,70,3
931,hand hard. I gave the waiter a franc and we went out. “Where should I,69,3
932,tell him?” I asked.,19,3
933,,0,3
934,"“Oh, tell him to drive around.”",31,3
935,,0,3
936,"I told the driver to go to the Parc Montsouris, and got in, and slammed",71,3
937,"the door. Brett was leaning back in the corner, her eyes closed. I got",70,3
938,in and sat beside her. The cab started with a jerk.,51,3
939,,0,3
940,"“Oh, darling, I’ve been so miserable,” Brett said.",50,3
941,,0,3

946,4,1,4
947,,0,4
948,,0,4
949,"The taxi went up the hill, passed the lighted square, then on into the",70,4
950,"dark, still climbing, then levelled out onto a dark street behind St.",69,4
951,"Etienne du Mont, went smoothly down the asphalt, passed the trees and",69,4
952,"the standing bus at the Place de la Contrescarpe, then turned onto the",70,4
953,cobbles of the Rue Mouffetard. There were lighted bars and late open,68,4
954,shops on each side of the street. We were sitting apart and we jolted,69,4
955,close together going down the old street. Brett’s hat was off. Her head,71,4
956,"was back. I saw her face in the lights from the open shops, then it was",71,4
957,"dark, then I saw her face clearly as we came out on the Avenue des",66,4
958,Gobelins. The street was torn up and men were working on the car-tracks,71,4
959,by the light of acetylene flares. Brett’s face was white and the long,69,4
960,line of her neck showed in the bright light of the flares. The street,69,4
961,was dark again and I kissed her. Our lips were tight together and then,70,4
962,"she turned away and pressed against the corner of the seat, as far away",71,4
963,as she could get. Her head was down.,36,4
964,,0,4
965,"“Don’t touch me,” she said. “Please don’t touch me.”",52,4
966,,0,4
967,“What’s the matter?”,20,4
968,,0,4
969,“I can’t stand it.”,19,4
970,,0,4
971,"“Oh, Brett.”",12,4
972,,0,4
973,"“You mustn’t. You must know. I can’t stand it, that’s all. Oh, darling,",71,4
974,please understand!”,19,4
975,,0,4
976,“Don’t you love me?”,20,4
977,,0,4
978,“Love you? I simply turn all to jelly when you touch me.”,57,4
979,,0,4
980,“Isn’t there anything we can do about it?”,42,4
981,,0,4
982,She was sitting up now. My arm was around her and she was leaning back,70,4
983,"against me, and we were quite calm. She was looking into my eyes with",69,4
984,that way she had of looking that made you wonder whether she really saw,71,4
985,out of her own eyes. They would look on and on after every one else’s,69,4
986,eyes in the world would have stopped looking. She looked as though there,72,4
987,"were nothing on earth she would not look at like that, and really she",69,4
988,was afraid of so many things.,29,4
989,,0,4
990,"“And there’s not a damn thing we could do,” I said.",51,4
991,,0,4
992,"“I don’t know,” she said. “I don’t want to go through that hell again.”",71,4
993,,0,4
994,“We’d better keep away from each other.”,40,4
995,,0,4
996,"“But, darling, I have to see you. It isn’t all that you know.”",62,4
997,,0,4
998,"“No, but it always gets to be.”",31,4
999,,0,4
1000,"“That’s my fault. Don’t we pay for all the things we do, though?”",65,4
1001,,0,4
1002,She had been looking into my eyes all the time. Her eyes had different,70,4
1003,"depths, sometimes they seemed perfectly flat. Now you could see all the",71,4
1004,way into them.,14,4
1005,,0,4
1006,“When I think of the hell I’ve put chaps through. I’m paying for it all,71,4
1007,now.”,5,4
1008,,0,4
1009,"“Don’t talk like a fool,” I said. “Besides, what happened to me is",66,4
1010,supposed to be funny. I never think about it.”,46,4
1011,,0,4
1012,"“Oh, no. I’ll lay you don’t.”",29,4
1013,,0,4
1014,"“Well, let’s shut up about it.”",31,4
1015,,0,4
1016,"“I laughed about it too, myself, once.” She wasn’t looking at me. “A",68,4
1017,friend of my brother’s came home that way from Mons. It seemed like a,69,4
1018,"hell of a joke. Chaps never know anything, do they?”",52,4
1019,,0,4
1020,"“No,” I said. “Nobody ever knows anything.”",43,4
1021,,0,4
1022,I was pretty well through with the subject. At one time or another I had,72,4
1023,"probably considered it from most of its various angles, including the",69,4
1024,one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment,69,4
1025,while remaining quite serious for the person possessing them.,61,4
1026,,0,4
1027,"“It’s funny,” I said. “It’s very funny. And it’s a lot of fun, too, to",70,4
1028,be in love.”,12,4
1029,,0,4
1030,“Do you think so?” her eyes looked flat again.,46,4
1031,,0,4
1032,“I don’t mean fun that way. In a way it’s an enjoyable feeling.”,64,4
1033,,0,4
1034,"“No,” she said. “I think it’s hell on earth.”",45,4
1035,,0,4
1036,“It’s good to see each other.”,30,4
1037,,0,4
1038,“No. I don’t think it is.”,26,4
1039,,0,4
1040,“Don’t you want to?”,20,4
1041,,0,4
1042,“I have to.”,12,4
1043,,0,4
1044,We were sitting now like two strangers. On the right was the Parc,65,4
1045,Montsouris. The restaurant where they have the pool of live trout and,69,4
1046,where you can sit and look out over the park was closed and dark. The,69,4
1047,driver leaned his head around.,30,4
1048,,0,4
1049,“Where do you want to go?” I asked. Brett turned her head away.,63,4
1050,,0,4
1051,"“Oh, go to the Select.”",23,4
1052,,0,4
1053,"“Café Select,” I told the driver. “Boulevard Montparnasse.” We drove",68,4
1054,"straight down, turning around the Lion de Belfort that guards the",65,4
1055,passing Montrouge trams. Brett looked straight ahead. On the Boulevard,70,4
1056,"Raspail, with the lights of Montparnasse in sight, Brett said: “Would",69,4
1057,you mind very much if I asked you to do something?”,51,4
1058,,0,4
1059,“Don’t be silly.”,17,4
1060,,0,4
1061,“Kiss me just once more before we get there.”,45,4
1062,,0,4
1063,When the taxi stopped I got out and paid. Brett came out putting on her,71,4
1064,hat. She gave me her hand as she stepped down. Her hand was shaky. “I,69,4
1065,"say, do I look too much of a mess?” She pulled her man’s felt hat down",70,4
1066,"and started in for the bar. Inside, against the bar and at tables, were",71,4
1067,most of the crowd who a been at the dance.,42,4
1068,,0,4
1069,"“Hello, you chaps,” Brett said. “I’m going to have a drink.”",60,4
1070,,0,4
1071,"“Oh, Brett! Brett!” the little Greek portrait-painter, who called",65,4
1072,"himself a duke, and whom everybody called Zizi, pushed up to her. “I got",72,4
1073,something fine to tell you.”,28,4
1074,,0,4
1075,"“Hello, Zizi,” Brett said.",26,4
1076,,0,4
1077,"“I want you to meet a friend,” Zizi said. A fat man came up.",60,4
1078,,0,4
1079,"“Count Mippipopolous, meet my friend Lady Ashley.”",50,4
1080,,0,4
1081,“How do you do?” said Brett.,28,4
1082,,0,4
1083,"“Well, does your Ladyship have a good time here in Paris?” asked Count",70,4
1084,"Mippipopolous, who wore an elk’s tooth on his watch-chain.",58,4
1085,,0,4
1086,"“Rather,” said Brett.",21,4
1087,,0,4
1088,"“Paris is a fine town all right,” said the count. “But I guess you have",71,4
1089,pretty big doings yourself over in London.”,43,4
1090,,0,4
1091,"“Oh, yes,” said Brett. “Enormous.”",34,4
1092,,0,4
1093,"Braddocks called to me from a table. “Barnes,” he said, “have a drink.",70,4
1094,That girl of yours got in a frightful row.”,43,4
1095,,0,4
1096,“What about?”,13,4
1097,,0,4
1098,“Something the patronne’s daughter said. A corking row. She was rather,70,4
1099,"splendid, you know. Showed her yellow card and demanded the patronne’s",70,4
1100,daughter’s too. I say it was a row.”,36,4
1101,,0,4
1102,“What finally happened?”,24,4
1103,,0,4
1104,"“Oh, some one took her home. Not a bad-looking girl. Wonderful command",70,4
1105,of the idiom. Do stay and have a drink.”,40,4
1106,,0,4
1107,"“No,” I said. “I must shove off. Seen Cohn?”",44,4
1108,,0,4
1109,"“He went home with Frances,” Mrs. Braddock put in.",50,4
1110,,0,4
1111,"“Poor chap, he looks awfully down,” Braddocks said.",51,4
1112,,0,4
1113,"“I dare say he is,” said Mrs. Braddocks.",40,4
1114,,0,4
1115,"“I have to shove off,” I said. “Good night.”",44,4
1116,,0,4
1117,I said good night to Brett at the bar. The count was buying champagne.,70,4
1118,"“Will you take a glass of wine with us, sir?” he asked.",55,4
1119,,0,4
1120,“No. Thanks awfully. I have to go.”,35,4
1121,,0,4
1122,“Really going?” Brett asked.,28,4
1123,,0,4
1124,"“Yes,” I said. “I’ve got a rotten headache.”",44,4
1125,,0,4
1126,“I’ll see you to-morrow?”,25,4
1127,,0,4
1128,“Come in at the office.”,24,4
1129,,0,4
1130,“Hardly.”,9,4
1131,,0,4
1132,"“Well, where will I see you?”",29,4
1133,,0,4
1134,“Anywhere around five o’clock.”,31,4
1135,,0,4
1136,“Make it the other side of town then.”,38,4
1137,,0,4
1138,“Good. I’ll be at the Crillon at five.”,39,4
1139,,0,4
1140,"“Try and be there,” I said.",27,4
1141,,0,4
1142,"“Don’t worry,” Brett said. “I’ve never let you down, have I?”",61,4
1143,,0,4
1144,“Heard from Mike?”,18,4
1145,,0,4
1146,“Letter to-day.”,16,4
1147,,0,4
1148,"“Good night, sir,” said the count.",34,4
1149,,0,4
1150,I went out onto the sidewalk and walked down toward the Boulevard St.,69,4
1151,"Michel, passed the tables of the Rotonde, still crowded, looked across",70,4
1152,"the street at the Dome, its tables running out to the edge of the",65,4
1153,"pavement. Some one waved at me from a table, I did not see who it was",69,4
1154,and went on. I wanted to get home. The Boulevard Montparnasse was,65,4
1155,"deserted. Lavigne’s was closed tight, and they were stacking the tables",71,4
1156,outside the Closerie des Lilas. I passed Ney’s statue standing among the,72,4
1157,new-leaved chestnut-trees in the arc-light. There was a faded purple,68,4
1158,wreath leaning against the base. I stopped and read the inscription:,68,4
1159,"from the Bonapartist Groups, some date; I forget. He looked very fine,",70,4
1160,"Marshal Ney in his top-boots, gesturing with his sword among the green",70,4
1161,"new horse-chestnut leaves. My flat was just across the street, a little",71,4
1162,way down the Boulevard St. Michel.,34,4
1163,,0,4
1164,There was a light in the concierge’s room and I knocked on the door and,71,4
1165,she gave me my mail. I wished her good night and went up-stairs. There,70,4
1166,were two letters and some papers. I looked at them under the gas-light,70,4
1167,in the dining-room. The letters were from the States. One was a bank,68,4
1168,statement. It showed a balance of $2432.60. I got out my check-book and,71,4
1169,"deducted four checks drawn since the first of the month, and discovered",71,4
1170,I had a balance of $1832.60. I wrote this on the back of the statement.,71,4
1171,The other letter was a wedding announcement. Mr. and Mrs. Aloysius Kirby,72,4
1172,announce the marriage of their daughter Katherine—I knew neither the,68,4
1173,girl nor the man she was marrying. They must be circularizing the town.,71,4
1174,It was a funny name. I felt sure I could remember anybody with a name,69,4
1175,like Aloysius. It was a good Catholic name. There was a crest on the,68,4
1176,announcement. Like Zizi the Greek duke. And that count. The count was,69,4
1177,"funny. Brett had a title, too. Lady Ashley. To hell with Brett. To hell",71,4
1178,"with you, Lady Ashley.",22,4
1179,,0,4
1180,"I lit the lamp beside the bed, turned off the gas, and opened the wide",70,4
1181,"windows. The bed was far back from the windows, and I sat with the",66,4
1182,"windows open and undressed by the bed. Outside a night train, running on",72,4
1183,"the street-car tracks, went by carrying vegetables to the markets. They",71,4
1184,"were noisy at night when you could not sleep. Undressing, I looked at",69,4
1185,myself in the mirror of the big armoire beside the bed. That was a,66,4
1186,"typically French way to furnish a room. Practical, too, I suppose. Of",69,4
1187,all the ways to be wounded. I suppose it was funny. I put on my pajamas,71,4
1188,"and got into bed. I had the two bull-fight papers, and I took their",67,4
1189,wrappers off. One was orange. The other yellow. They would both have the,72,4
1190,"same news, so whichever I read first would spoil the other. _Le Toril_",70,4
1191,"was the better paper, so I started to read it. I read it all the way",68,4
1192,"through, including the Petite Correspondance and the Cornigrams. I blew",71,4
1193,out the lamp. Perhaps I would be able to sleep.,47,4
1194,,0,4
1195,"My head started to work. The old grievance. Well, it was a rotten way to",72,4
1196,be wounded and flying on a joke front like the Italian. In the Italian,70,4
1197,hospital we were going to form a society. It had a funny name in,64,4
1198,"Italian. I wonder what became of the others, the Italians. That was in",70,4
1199,"the Ospedale Maggiore in Milano, Padiglione Ponte. The next building was",72,4
1200,"the Padiglione Zonda. There was a statue of Ponte, or maybe it was",66,4
1201,Zonda. That was where the liaison colonel came to visit me. That was,68,4
1202,funny. That was about the first funny thing. I was all bandaged up. But,71,4
1203,"they had told him about it. Then he made that wonderful speech: “You, a",71,4
1204,"foreigner, an Englishman” (any foreigner was an Englishman) “have given",71,4
1205,more than your life.” What a speech! I would like to have it illuminated,72,4
1206,to hang in the office. He never laughed. He was putting himself in my,69,4
1207,"place, I guess. “Che mala fortuna! Che mala fortuna!”",53,4
1208,,0,4
1209,"I never used to realize it, I guess. I try and play it along and just",69,4
1210,not make trouble for people. Probably I never would have had any trouble,72,4
1211,if I hadn’t run into Brett when they shipped me to England. I suppose,69,4
1212,"she only wanted what she couldn’t have. Well, people were that way. To",70,4
1213,hell with people. The Catholic Church had an awfully good way of,64,4
1214,"handling all that. Good advice, anyway. Not to think about it. Oh, it",69,4
1215,was swell advice. Try and take it sometime. Try and take it.,60,4
1216,,0,4
1217,I lay awake thinking and my mind jumping around. Then I couldn’t keep,69,4
1218,"away from it, and I started to think about Brett and all the rest of it",71,4
1219,went away. I was thinking about Brett and my mind stopped jumping around,72,4
1220,and started to go in sort of smooth waves. Then all of a sudden I,65,4
1221,started to cry. Then after a while it was better and I lay in bed and,69,4
1222,"listened to the heavy trams go by and way down the street, and then I",69,4
1223,went to sleep.,14,4
1224,,0,4
1225,I woke up. There was a row going on outside. I listened and I thought I,71,4
1226,recognized a voice. I put on a dressing-gown and went to the door. The,70,4
1227,concierge was talking down-stairs. She was very angry. I heard my name,70,4
1228,and called down the stairs.,27,4
1229,,0,4
1230,"“Is that you, Monsieur Barnes?” the concierge called.",53,4
1231,,0,4
1232,“Yes. It’s me.”,15,4
1233,,0,4
1234,“There’s a species of woman here who’s waked the whole street up. What,70,4
1235,kind of a dirty business at this time of night! She says she must see,69,4
1236,you. I’ve told her you’re asleep.”,34,4
1237,,0,4
1238,Then I heard Brett’s voice. Half asleep I had been sure it was,62,4
1239,Georgette. I don’t know why. She could not have known my address.,65,4
1240,,0,4
1241,"“Will you send her up, please?”",31,4
1242,,0,4
1243,Brett came up the stairs. I saw she was quite drunk. “Silly thing to,68,4
1244,"do,” she said. “Make an awful row. I say, you weren’t asleep, were you?”",72,4
1245,,0,4
1246,“What did you think I was doing?”,33,4
1247,,0,4
1248,“Don’t know. What time is it?”,30,4
1249,,0,4
1250,I looked at the clock. It was half-past four. “Had no idea what hour it,71,4
1251,"was,” Brett said. “I say, can a chap sit down? Don’t be cross, darling.",71,4
1252,Just left the count. He brought me here.”,41,4
1253,,0,4
1254,“What’s he like?” I was getting brandy and soda and glasses.,60,4
1255,,0,4
1256,"“Just a little,” said Brett. “Don’t try and make me drunk. The count?",69,4
1257,"Oh, rather. He’s quite one of us.”",34,4
1258,,0,4
1259,“Is he a count?”,16,4
1260,,0,4
1261,"“Here’s how. I rather think so, you know. Deserves to be, anyhow. Knows",71,4
1262,hell’s own amount about people. Don’t know where he got it all. Owns a,70,4
1263,chain of sweetshops in the States.”,35,4
1264,,0,4
1265,She sipped at her glass.,24,4
1266,,0,4
1267,“Think he called it a chain. Something like that. Linked them all up.,69,4
1268,"Told me a little about it. Damned interesting. He’s one of us, though.",70,4
1269,"Oh, quite. No doubt. One can always tell.”",42,4
1270,,0,4
1271,She took another drink.,23,4
1272,,0,4
1273,"“How do I buck on about all this? You don’t mind, do you? He’s putting",70,4
1274,"up for Zizi, you know.”",23,4
1275,,0,4
1276,"“Is Zizi really a duke, too?”",29,4
1277,,0,4
1278,"“I shouldn’t wonder. Greek, you know. Rotten painter. I rather liked the",72,4
1279,count.”,7,4
1280,,0,4
1281,“Where did you go with him?”,28,4
1282,,0,4
1283,"“Oh, everywhere. He just brought me here now. Offered me ten thousand",69,4
1284,dollars to go to Biarritz with him. How much is that in pounds?”,64,4
1285,,0,4
1286,“Around two thousand.”,22,4
1287,,0,4
1288,“Lot of money. I told him I couldn’t do it. He was awfully nice about,69,4
1289,it. Told him I knew too many people in Biarritz.”,49,4
1290,,0,4
1291,Brett laughed.,14,4

1293,"“I say, you are slow on the up-take,” she said. I had only sipped my",68,4
1294,brandy and soda. I took a long drink.,37,4

1296,"“That’s better. Very funny,” Brett said. “Then he wanted me to go to",68,4
1297,Cannes with him. Told him I knew too many people in Cannes. Monte Carlo.,72,4
1298,Told him I knew too many people in Monte Carlo. Told him I knew too many,72,4

1301,"She looked at me, her hand on the table, her glass raised. “Don’t look",70,4
1302,"like that,” she said. “Told him I was in love with you. True, too. Don’t",72,4
1303,look like that. He was damn nice about it. Wants to drive us out to,67,4

1315,“The count?”,12,4
1316,,0,4
1317,“Himself. And a chauffeur in livery. Going to drive me around and have,70,4

1345,We kissed again on the stairs and as I called for the cordon the,64,4
1346,concierge muttered something behind her door. I went back up-stairs and,71,4
1347,from the open window watched Brett walking up the street to the big,67,4
1348,limousine drawn up to the curb under the arc-light. She got in and it,69,4
1349,started off. I turned around. On the table was an empty glass and a,67,4
1350,glass half-full of brandy and soda. I took them both out to the kitchen,71,4
1351,and poured the half-full glass down the sink. I turned off the gas in,69,4
1352,"the dining-room, kicked off my slippers sitting on the bed, and got into",72,4
1353,"bed. This was Brett, that I had felt like crying about. Then I thought",70,4
1354,"of her walking up the street and stepping into the car, as I had last",69,4
1355,"seen her, and of course in a little while I felt like hell again. It is",71,4
1356,"awfully easy to be hard-boiled about everything in the daytime, but at",70,4
1357,night it is another thing.,26,4

1366,In the morning I walked down the Boulevard to the rue Soufflot for,66,5
1367,coffee and brioche. It was a fine morning. The horse-chestnut trees in,70,5
1368,the Luxembourg gardens were in bloom. There was the pleasant,60,5
1369,early-morning feeling of a hot day. I read the papers with the coffee,69,5
1370,and then smoked a cigarette. The flower-women were coming up from the,69,5
1371,market and arranging their daily stock. Students went by going up to the,72,5
1372,"law school, or down to the Sorbonne. The Boulevard was busy with trams",70,5
1373,and people going to work. I got on an S bus and rode down to the,64,5
1374,"Madeleine, standing on the back platform. From the Madeleine I walked",69,5
1375,"along the Boulevard des Capucines to the Opéra, and up to my office. I",70,5
1376,passed the man with the jumping frogs and the man with the boxer toys. I,72,5
1377,stepped aside to avoid walking into the thread with which his girl,66,5
1378,"assistant manipulated the boxers. She was standing looking away, the",68,5
1379,thread in her folded hands. The man was urging two tourists to buy.,67,5
1380,Three more tourists had stopped and were watching. I walked on behind a,71,5
1381,man who was pushing a roller that printed the name CINZANO on the,65,5
1382,sidewalk in damp letters. All along people were going to work. It felt,70,5
1383,pleasant to be going to work. I walked across the avenue and turned in,70,5
1384,to my office.,13,5
1385,,0,5
1386,"Up-stairs in the office I read the French morning papers, smoked, and",69,5
1387,then sat at the typewriter and got off a good morning’s work. At eleven,71,5
1388,o’clock I went over to the Quai d’Orsay in a taxi and went in and sat,69,5
1389,"with about a dozen correspondents, while the foreign-office mouthpiece,",71,5
1390,"a young Nouvelle Revue Française diplomat in horn-rimmed spectacles,",68,5
1391,talked and answered questions for half an hour. The President of the,68,5
1392,"Council was in Lyons making a speech, or, rather he was on his way back.",72,5
1393,Several people asked questions to hear themselves talk and there were a,71,5
1394,couple of questions asked by news service men who wanted to know the,68,5
1395,answers. There was no news. I shared a taxi back from the Quai d’Orsay,70,5
1396,with Woolsey and Krum.,22,5
1397,,0,5
1398,"“What do you do nights, Jake?” asked Krum. “I never see you around.”",68,5
1399,,0,5
1400,"“Oh, I’m over in the Quarter.”",30,5
1401,,0,5
1402,"“I’m coming over some night. The Dingo. That’s the great place, isn’t",69,5
1403,it?”,4,5
1404,,0,5
1405,"“Yes. That, or this new dive, The Select.”",42,5
1406,,0,5
1407,"“I’ve meant to get over,” said Krum. “You know how it is, though, with a",72,5
1408,wife and kids.”,15,5
1409,,0,5
1410,“Playing any tennis?” Woolsey asked.,36,5
1411,,0,5
1412,"“Well, no,” said Krum. “I can’t say I’ve played any this year. I’ve",67,5
1413,"tried to get away, but Sundays it’s always rained, and the courts are so",72,5
1414,damned crowded.”,16,5
1415,,0,5
1416,"“The Englishmen all have Saturday off,” Woolsey said.",53,5
1417,,0,5
1418,"“Lucky beggars,” said Krum. “Well, I’ll tell you. Some day I’m not going",72,5
1419,to be working for an agency. Then I’ll have plenty of time to get out in,72,5
1420,the country.”,13,5
1421,,0,5
1422,“That’s the thing to do. Live out in the country and have a little car.”,72,5
1423,,0,5
1424,“I’ve been thinking some about getting a car next year.”,56,5
1425,,0,5
1426,"I banged on the glass. The chauffeur stopped. “Here’s my street,” I",67,5
1427,said. “Come in and have a drink.”,33,5
1428,,0,5
1429,"“Thanks, old man,” Krum said. Woolsey shook his head. “I’ve got to file",71,5
1430,that line he got off this morning.”,35,5
1431,,0,5
1432,I put a two-franc piece in Krum’s hand.,39,5
1433,,0,5
1434,"“You’re crazy, Jake,” he said. “This is on me.”",47,5
1435,,0,5
1436,"“It’s all on the office, anyway.”",33,5
1437,,0,5
1438,“Nope. I want to get it.”,25,5
1439,,0,5
1440,I waved good-by. Krum put his head out. “See you at the lunch on,64,5
1441,Wednesday.”,11,5
1442,,0,5
1443,“You bet.”,10,5
1444,,0,5
1445,I went to the office in the elevator. Robert Cohn was waiting for me.,69,5
1446,"“Hello, Jake,” he said. “Going out to lunch?”",45,5
1447,,0,5
1448,“Yes. Let me see if there is anything new.”,43,5
1449,,0,5
1450,“Where will we eat?”,20,5
1451,,0,5
1452,“Anywhere.”,11,5
1453,,0,5
1454,I was looking over my desk. “Where do you want to eat?”,55,5
1455,,0,5
1456,“How about Wetzel’s? They’ve got good hors d’œuvres.”,53,5
1457,,0,5
1458,In the restaurant we ordered hors d’œuvres and beer. The sommelier,66,5
1459,"brought the beer, tall, beaded on the outside of the steins, and cold.",70,5
1460,There were a dozen different dishes of hors d’œuvres.,53,5
1461,,0,5
1462,“Have any fun last night?” I asked.,35,5
1463,,0,5
1464,“No. I don’t think so.”,23,5
1465,,0,5
1466,“How’s the writing going?”,26,5
1467,,0,5
1468,“Rotten. I can’t get this second book going.”,45,5
1469,,0,5
1470,“That happens to everybody.”,28,5
1471,,0,5
1472,"“Oh, I’m sure of that. It gets me worried, though.”",51,5
1473,,0,5
1474,“Thought any more about going to South America?”,48,5
1475,,0,5
1476,“I mean that.”,14,5
1477,,0,5
1478,"“Well, why don’t you start off?”",32,5
1479,,0,5
1480,“Frances.”,10,5
1481,,0,5
1482,"“Well,” I said, “take her with you.”",36,5
1483,,0,5
1484,“She wouldn’t like it. That isn’t the sort of thing she likes. She likes,72,5
1485,a lot of people around.”,24,5
1486,,0,5
1487,“Tell her to go to hell.”,25,5
1488,,0,5
1489,“I can’t. I’ve got certain obligations to her.”,47,5
1490,,0,5
1491,He shoved the sliced cucumbers away and took a pickled herring.,63,5
1492,,0,5
1493,"“What do you know about Lady Brett Ashley, Jake?”",49,5
1494,,0,5
1495,"“Her name’s Lady Ashley. Brett’s her own name. She’s a nice girl,” I",68,5
1496,said. “She’s getting a divorce and she’s going to marry Mike Campbell.,70,5
1497,He’s over in Scotland now. Why?”,32,5
1498,,0,5
1499,“She’s a remarkably attractive woman.”,38,5
1500,,0,5
1501,“Isn’t she?”,12,5
1502,,0,5
1503,"“There’s a certain quality about her, a certain fineness. She seems to",70,5
1504,be absolutely fine and straight.”,33,5
1505,,0,5
1506,“She’s very nice.”,18,5
1507,,0,5
1508,"“I don’t know how to describe the quality,” Cohn said. “I suppose it’s",70,5
1509,breeding.”,10,5
1510,,0,5
1511,“You sound as though you liked her pretty well.”,48,5
1512,,0,5
1513,“I do. I shouldn’t wonder if I were in love with her.”,54,5
1514,,0,5
1515,"“She’s a drunk,” I said. “She’s in love with Mike Campbell, and she’s",69,5
1516,going to marry him. He’s going to be rich as hell some day.”,60,5
1517,,0,5
1518,“I don’t believe she’ll ever marry him.”,40,5
1519,,0,5
1520,“Why not?”,10,5
1521,,0,5
1522,“I don’t know. I just don’t believe it. Have you known her a long time?”,72,5
1523,,0,5
1524,"“Yes,” I said. “She was a V. A. D. in a hospital I was in during the",68,5
1525,war.”,5,5
1526,,0,5
1527,“She must have been just a kid then.”,37,5
1528,,0,5
1529,“She’s thirty-four now.”,24,5
1530,,0,5
1531,“When did she marry Ashley?”,28,5
1532,,0,5
1533,“During the war. Her own true love had just kicked off with the,63,5
1534,dysentery.”,11,5
1535,,0,5
1536,“You talk sort of bitter.”,26,5
1537,,0,5
1538,“Sorry. I didn’t mean to. I was just trying to give you the facts.”,67,5
1539,,0,5
1540,“I don’t believe she would marry anybody she didn’t love.”,58,5
1541,,0,5
1542,"“Well,” I said. “She’s done it twice.”",38,5
1543,,0,5
1544,“I don’t believe it.”,21,5
1545,,0,5
1546,"“Well,” I said, “don’t ask me a lot of fool questions if you don’t like",71,5
1547,the answers.”,13,5
1548,,0,5
1549,“I didn’t ask you that.”,24,5
1550,,0,5
1551,“You asked me what I knew about Brett Ashley.”,46,5
1552,,0,5
1553,“I didn’t ask you to insult her.”,33,5
1554,,0,5
1555,"“Oh, go to hell.”",17,5
1556,,0,5
1557,"He stood up from the table his face white, and stood there white and",68,5
1558,angry behind the little plates of hors d’œuvres.,48,5
1559,,0,5
1560,"“Sit down,” I said. “Don’t be a fool.”",38,5
1561,,0,5
1562,“You’ve got to take that back.”,31,5
1563,,0,5
1564,"“Oh, cut out the prep-school stuff.”",36,5
1565,,0,5
1566,“Take it back.”,15,5
1567,,0,5
1568,“Sure. Anything. I never heard of Brett Ashley. How’s that?,59,5
1569,,0,5
1570,“No. Not that. About me going to hell.”,39,5
1571,,0,5
1572,"“Oh, don’t go to hell,” I said. “Stick around. We’re just starting",66,5
1573,lunch.”,7,5
1574,,0,5
1575,Cohn smiled again and sat down. He seemed glad to sit down. What the,68,5
1576,hell would he have done if he hadn’t sat down? “You say such damned,67,5
1577,"insulting things, Jake.”",24,5
1578,,0,5
1579,“I’m sorry. I’ve got a nasty tongue. I never mean it when I say nasty,69,5
1580,things.”,8,5
1581,,0,5
1582,"“I know it,” Cohn said. “You’re really about the best friend I have,",68,5
1583,Jake.”,6,5
1584,,0,5
1585,"God help you, I thought. “Forget what I said,” I said out loud. “I’m",68,5
1586,sorry.”,7,5
1587,,0,5
1588,“It’s all right. It’s fine. I was just sore for a minute.”,58,5
1589,,0,5
1590,“Good. Let’s get something else to eat.”,40,5
1591,,0,5
1592,After we finished the lunch we walked up to the Café de la Paix and had,71,5
1593,"coffee. I could feel Cohn wanted to bring up Brett again, but I held him",72,5
1594,"off it. We talked about one thing and another, and I left him to come to",72,5
1595,the office.,11,5
1596,,0,5
1597,,0,5
1598,,0,5
1599,,0,5
1601,6,1,6
1602,,0,6
1603,,0,6
1604,At five o’clock I was in the Hotel Crillon waiting for Brett. She was,69,6
1605,"not there, so I sat down and wrote some letters. They were not very good",72,6
1606,letters but I hoped their being on Crillon stationery would help them.,70,6
1607,"Brett did not turn up, so about quarter to six I went down to the bar",69,6
1608,and had a Jack Rose with George the barman. Brett had not been in the,69,6
1609,"bar either, and so I looked for her up-stairs on my way out, and took a",71,6
1610,taxi to the Café Select. Crossing the Seine I saw a string of barges,68,6
1611,"being towed empty down the current, riding high, the bargemen at the",68,6
1612,sweeps as they came toward the bridge. The river looked nice. It was,68,6
1613,always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris.,42,6
1614,,0,6
1615,The taxi rounded the statue of the inventor of the semaphore engaged in,71,6
1616,"doing same, and turned up the Boulevard Raspail, and I sat back to let",70,6
1617,that part of the ride pass. The Boulevard Raspail always made dull,66,6
1618,riding. It was like a certain stretch on the P. L. M. between,61,6
1619,Fontainebleau and Montereau that always made me feel bored and dead and,71,6
1620,dull until it was over. I suppose it is some association of ideas that,70,6
1621,makes those dead places in a journey. There are other streets in Paris,70,6
1622,as ugly as the Boulevard Raspail. It is a street I do not mind walking,70,6
1623,down at all. But I cannot stand to ride along it. Perhaps I had read,68,6
1624,something about it once. That was the way Robert Cohn was about all of,70,6
1625,Paris. I wondered where Cohn got that incapacity to enjoy Paris.,64,6
1626,"Possibly from Mencken. Mencken hates Paris, I believe. So many young men",72,6
1627,get their likes and dislikes from Mencken.,42,6
1628,,0,6
1629,The taxi stopped in front of the Rotonde. No matter what café in,64,6
1630,Montparnasse you ask a taxi-driver to bring you to from the right bank,70,6
1631,"of the river, they always take you to the Rotonde. Ten years from now it",72,6
1632,"will probably be the Dome. It was near enough, anyway. I walked past the",72,6
1633,sad tables of the Rotonde to the Select. There were a few people inside,71,6
1634,"at the bar, and outside, alone, sat Harvey Stone. He had a pile of",66,6
1635,"saucers in front of him, and he needed a shave.",47,6
1636,,0,6
1637,"“Sit down,” said Harvey, “I’ve been looking for you.”",53,6
1638,,0,6
1639,“What’s the matter?”,20,6
1640,,0,6
1641,“Nothing. Just looking for you.”,32,6
1642,,0,6
1643,“Been out to the races?”,24,6
1644,,0,6
1645,“No. Not since Sunday.”,23,6
1646,,0,6
1647,“What do you hear from the States?”,35,6
1648,,0,6
1649,“Nothing. Absolutely nothing.”,30,6
1650,,0,6
1651,“What’s the matter?”,20,6
1652,,0,6
1653,“I don’t know. I’m through with them. I’m absolutely through with them.”,72,6
1654,,0,6
1655,He leaned forward and looked me in the eye.,43,6
1656,,0,6
1657,"“Do you want to know something, Jake?”",38,6
1658,,0,6
1659,“Yes.”,6,6
1660,,0,6
1661,“I haven’t had anything to eat for five days.”,46,6
1662,,0,6
1663,I figured rapidly back in my mind. It was three days ago that Harvey had,72,6
1664,won two hundred francs from me shaking poker dice in the New York Bar.,70,6
1665,,0,6
1666,“What’s the matter?”,20,6
1667,,0,6
1668,"“No money. Money hasn’t come,” he paused. “I tell you it’s strange,",67,6
1669,Jake. When I’m like this I just want to be alone. I want to stay in my,70,6
1670,own room. I’m like a cat.”,26,6
1671,,0,6
1672,I felt in my pocket.,20,6
1673,,0,6
1674,"“Would a hundred help you any, Harvey?”",39,6
1675,,0,6
1676,“Yes.”,6,6
1677,,0,6
1678,“Come on. Let’s go and eat.”,28,6
1679,,0,6
1680,“There’s no hurry. Have a drink.”,33,6
1681,,0,6
1682,“Better eat.”,13,6
1683,,0,6
1684,“No. When I get like this I don’t care whether I eat or not.”,61,6
1685,,0,6
1686,We had a drink. Harvey added my saucer to his own pile.,55,6
1687,,0,6
1688,"“Do you know Mencken, Harvey?”",30,6
1689,,0,6
1690,“Yes. Why?”,11,6
1691,,0,6
1692,“What’s he like?”,17,6
1693,,0,6
1694,“He’s all right. He says some pretty funny things. Last time I had,66,6
1695,"dinner with him we talked about Hoffenheimer. ‘The trouble is,’ he said,",72,6
1696,‘he’s a garter snapper.’ That’s not bad.”,41,6
1697,,0,6
1698,“That’s not bad.”,17,6
1699,,0,6
1700,"“He’s through now,” Harvey went on. “He’s written about all the things",70,6

1708,"“Well,” I said. “That was a good thing, too.”",45,6
1709,,0,6
1710,"“Sure,” said Harvey. So we sat and thought deeply for a while.",62,6

1712,“Have another port?”,20,6
1713,,0,6
1714,"“All right,” said Harvey.",25,6

1716,"“There comes Cohn,” I said. Robert Cohn was crossing the street.",64,6
1717,,0,6
1718,"“That moron,” said Harvey. Cohn came up to our table.",53,6
1719,,0,6
1720,"“Hello, you bums,” he said.",27,6
1721,,0,6
1722,"“Hello, Robert,” Harvey said. “I was just telling Jake here that you’re",71,6
1723,a moron.”,9,6

1725,“What do you mean?”,19,6
1726,,0,6
1727,“Tell us right off. Don’t think. What would you rather do if you could,70,6
1728,do anything you wanted?”,24,6
1729,,0,6
1730,Cohn started to consider.,25,6
1731,,0,6
1732,“Don’t think. Bring it right out.”,34,6
1733,,0,6
1734,"“I don’t know,” Cohn said. “What’s it all about, anyway?”",57,6
1735,,0,6
1736,“I mean what would you rather do. What comes into your head first. No,69,6
1737,matter how silly it is.”,24,6
1738,,0,6
1739,"“I don’t know,” Cohn said. “I think I’d rather play football again with",71,6
1740,"what I know about handling myself, now.”",40,6
1741,,0,6
1742,"“I misjudged you,” Harvey said. “You’re not a moron. You’re only a case",71,6
1743,of arrested development.”,25,6
1744,,0,6
1745,"“You’re awfully funny, Harvey,” Cohn said. “Some day somebody will push",71,6
1746,your face in.”,14,6
1747,,0,6
1748,"Harvey Stone laughed. “You think so. They won’t, though. Because it",67,6
1749,wouldn’t make any difference to me. I’m not a fighter.”,55,6
1750,,0,6
1751,“It would make a difference to you if anybody did it.”,54,6
1752,,0,6
1753,"“No, it wouldn’t. That’s where you make your big mistake. Because you’re",72,6
1754,not intelligent.”,17,6
1755,,0,6
1756,“Cut it out about me.”,22,6
1757,,0,6
1758,"“Sure,” said Harvey. “It doesn’t make any difference to me. You don’t",69,6
1759,mean anything to me.”,21,6
1760,,0,6
1761,"“Come on, Harvey,” I said. “Have another porto.”",48,6
1762,,0,6
1763,"“No,” he said. “I’m going up the street and eat. See you later, Jake.”",70,6
1764,,0,6
1765,He walked out and up the street. I watched him crossing the street,66,6
1766,"through the taxis, small, heavy, slowly sure of himself in the traffic.",71,6
1767,,0,6
1768,"“He always gets me sore,” Cohn said. “I can’t stand him.”",57,6
1769,,0,6
1770,"“I like him,” I said. “I’m fond of him. You don’t want to get sore at",69,6
1771,him.”,5,6
1772,,0,6
1773,"“I know it,” Cohn said. “He just gets on my nerves.”",52,6
1774,,0,6
1775,“Write this afternoon?”,23,6
1776,,0,6
1777,“No. I couldn’t get it going. It’s harder to do than my first book. I’m,71,6
1778,having a hard time handling it.”,32,6
1779,,0,6
1780,The sort of healthy conceit that he had when he returned from America,69,6
1781,"early in the spring was gone. Then he had been sure of his work, only",69,6
1782,with these personal longings for adventure. Now the sureness was gone.,70,6
1783,Somehow I feel I have not shown Robert Cohn clearly. The reason is that,71,6
1784,"until he fell in love with Brett, I never heard him make one remark that",72,6
1785,"would, in any way, detach him from other people. He was nice to watch on",72,6
1786,"the tennis-court, he had a good body, and he kept it in shape; he",65,6
1787,"handled his cards well at bridge, and he had a funny sort of",60,6
1788,undergraduate quality about him. If he were in a crowd nothing he said,70,6
1789,"stood out. He wore what used to be called polo shirts at school, and may",72,6
1790,"be called that still, but he was not professionally youthful. I do not",70,6
1791,believe he thought about his clothes much. Externally he had been formed,72,6
1792,at Princeton. Internally he had been moulded by the two women who had,69,6
1793,"trained him. He had a nice, boyish sort of cheerfulness that had never",70,6
1794,"been trained out of him, and I probably have not brought it out. He",67,6
1795,"loved to win at tennis. He probably loved to win as much as Lenglen, for",72,6
1796,"instance. On the other hand, he was not angry at being beaten. When he",70,6
1797,fell in love with Brett his tennis game went all to pieces. People beat,71,6
1798,him who had never had a chance with him. He was very nice about it.,67,6
1799,,0,6
1800,"Anyhow, we were sitting on the terrace of the Café Select, and Harvey",69,6
1801,Stone had just crossed the street.,34,6

1803,"“Come on up to the Lilas,” I said.",34,6
1804,,0,6
1805,“I have a date.”,16,6

1810,,0,6
1811,“There she is.”,15,6
1812,,0,6
1813,Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a,68,6
1814,very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and,70,6
1815,smiled. We watched her cross the street.,40,6
1816,,0,6
1817,"“Hello,” she said, “I’m so glad you’re here, Jake. I’ve been wanting to",71,6
1818,talk to you.”,13,6
1819,,0,6
1820,"“Hello, Frances,” said Cohn. He smiled.",39,6
1821,,0,6
1822,"“Why, hello, Robert. Are you here?” She went on, talking rapidly. “I’ve",71,6
1823,had the darndest time. This one”—shaking her head at Cohn—“didn’t come,70,6
1824,home for lunch.”,16,6
1825,,0,6
1826,“I wasn’t supposed to.”,23,6
1827,,0,6
1828,"“Oh, I know. But you didn’t say anything about it to the cook. Then I",69,6
1829,"had a date myself, and Paula wasn’t at her office. I went to the Ritz",69,6
1830,"and waited for her, and she never came, and of course I didn’t have",67,6
1831,enough money to lunch at the Ritz——”,36,6
1832,,0,6
1833,“What did you do?”,18,6
1834,,0,6
1835,"“Oh, went out, of course.” She spoke in a sort of imitation joyful",66,6
1836,"manner. “I always keep my appointments. No one keeps theirs, nowadays. I",72,6
1837,"ought to know better. How are you, Jake, anyway?”",49,6
1838,,0,6
1839,“Fine.”,7,6
1840,,0,6
1841,"“That was a fine girl you had at the dance, and then went off with that",71,6
1842,Brett one.”,11,6
1843,,0,6
1844,“Don’t you like her?” Cohn asked.,33,6
1845,,0,6
1846,“I think she’s perfectly charming. Don’t you?”,46,6
1847,,0,6
1848,Cohn said nothing.,18,6
1849,,0,6
1850,"“Look, Jake. I want to talk with you. Would you come over with me to the",72,6
1851,"Dome? You’ll stay here, won’t you, Robert? Come on, Jake.”",58,6
1852,,0,6
1853,We crossed the Boulevard Montparnasse and sat down at a table. A boy,68,6
1854,"came up with the _Paris Times_, and I bought one and opened it.",63,6
1855,,0,6
1856,"“What’s the matter, Frances?”",29,6
1857,,0,6
1858,"“Oh, nothing,” she said, “except that he wants to leave me.”",60,6
1859,,0,6
1860,“How do you mean?”,18,6
1861,,0,6
1862,"“Oh, he told every one that we were going to be married, and I told my",70,6
1863,"mother and every one, and now he doesn’t want to do it.”",56,6
1864,,0,6
1865,“What’s the matter?”,20,6
1866,,0,6
1867,“He’s decided he hasn’t lived enough. I knew it would happen when he,68,6
1868,went to New York.”,18,6
1869,,0,6
1870,"She looked up, very bright-eyed and trying to talk inconsequentially.",69,6
1871,,0,6
1872,“I wouldn’t marry him if he doesn’t want to. Of course I wouldn’t. I,68,6
1873,wouldn’t marry him now for anything. But it does seem to me to be a,67,6
1874,"little late now, after we’ve waited three years, and I’ve just gotten my",72,6
1875,divorce.”,9,6
1876,,0,6
1877,I said nothing.,15,6
1878,,0,6
1879,"“We were going to celebrate so, and instead we’ve just had scenes. It’s",71,6
1880,"so childish. We have dreadful scenes, and he cries and begs me to be",68,6
1881,"reasonable, but he says he just can’t do it.”",45,6
1882,,0,6
1883,“It’s rotten luck.”,19,6
1884,,0,6
1885,“I should say it is rotten luck. I’ve wasted two years and a half on him,72,6
1886,now. And I don’t know now if any man will ever want to marry me. Two,68,6
1887,"years ago I could have married anybody I wanted, down at Cannes. All the",72,6
1888,old ones that wanted to marry somebody chic and settle down were crazy,70,6
1889,about me. Now I don’t think I could get anybody.”,49,6
1890,,0,6
1891,"“Sure, you could marry anybody.”",32,6
1892,,0,6
1893,"“No, I don’t believe it. And I’m fond of him, too. And I’d like to have",71,6

1895,,0,6
1896,"She looked at me very brightly. “I never liked children much, but I",67,6

1901,,0,6
1902,"“Oh, yes. He’s got children, and he’s got money, and he’s got a rich",68,6

1908,,0,6
1909,"“It isn’t right. It’s my own fault and it’s not, too. I ought to have",69,6
1910,known better. And when I tell him he just cries and says he can’t marry.,72,6
1911,Why can’t he marry? I’d be a good wife. I’m easy to get along with. I,69,6

1919,“And of course there isn’t anything I can do.”,46,6
1920,,0,6
1921,“No. Just don’t let him know I talked to you. I know what he wants.” Now,72,6
1922,"for the first time she dropped her bright, terribly cheerful manner. “He",72,6
1923,"wants to go back to New York alone, and be there when his book comes out",72,6
1924,so when a lot of little chickens like it. That’s what he wants.”,64,6

1927,,0,6
1928,"“You don’t know him like I do, Jake. That’s what he wants to do. I know",71,6

1931,,0,6
1932,“Want to go back to the café?”,30,6
1933,,0,6
1934,“Yes. Come on.”,15,6
1935,,0,6
1936,We got up from the table—they had never brought us a drink—and started,70,6
1937,"across the street toward the Select, where Cohn sat smiling at us from",70,6
1938,behind the marble-topped table.,31,6
1939,,0,6
1940,"“Well, what are you smiling at?” Frances asked him. “Feel pretty happy?”",72,6
1941,,0,6
1942,“I was smiling at you and Jake with your secrets.”,50,6
1943,,0,6
1944,"“Oh, what I’ve told Jake isn’t any secret. Everybody will know it soon",70,6
1945,enough. I only wanted to give Jake a decent version.”,53,6

1947,“What was it? About your going to England?”,43,6
1948,,0,6
1949,"“Yes, about my going to England. Oh, Jake! I forgot to tell you. I’m",68,6
1950,going to England.”,18,6
1951,,0,6
1952,“Isn’t that fine!”,18,6
1953,,0,6
1954,"“Yes, that’s the way it’s done in the very best families. Robert’s",66,6
1955,sending me. He’s going to give me two hundred pounds and then I’m going,71,6
1956,"to visit friends. Won’t it be lovely? The friends don’t know about it,",70,6
1957,yet.”,5,6
1958,,0,6
1959,She turned to Cohn and smiled at him. He was not smiling now.,61,6
1960,,0,6
1961,"“You were only going to give me a hundred pounds, weren’t you, Robert?",70,6
1962,But I made him give me two hundred. He’s really very generous. Aren’t,69,6
1963,"you, Robert?”",13,6
1964,,0,6
1965,I do not know how people could say such terrible things to Robert Cohn.,71,6
1966,There are people to whom you could not say insulting things. They give,70,6
1967,"you a feeling that the world would be destroyed, would actually be",66,6
1968,"destroyed before your eyes, if you said certain things. But here was",68,6
1969,"Cohn taking it all. Here it was, all going on right before me, and I did",72,6
1970,not even feel an impulse to try and stop it. And this was friendly,66,6
1971,joking to what went on later.,29,6
1972,,0,6
1973,"“How can you say such things, Frances?” Cohn interrupted.",57,6
1974,,0,6
1975,“Listen to him. I’m going to England. I’m going to visit friends. Ever,70,6
1976,"visit friends that didn’t want you? Oh, they’ll have to take me, all",68,6
1977,"right. ‘How do you do, my dear? Such a long time since we’ve seen you.",70,6
1978,"And how is your dear mother?’ Yes, how is my dear mother? She put all",69,6
1979,"her money into French war bonds. Yes, she did. Probably the only person",71,6
1980,in the world that did. ‘And what about Robert?’ or else very careful,68,6
1981,"talking around Robert. ‘You must be most careful not to mention him, my",71,6
1982,dear. Poor Frances has had a most unfortunate experience.’ Won’t it be,70,6
1983,"fun, Robert? Don’t you think it will be fun, Jake?”",51,6
1984,,0,6
1985,She turned to me with that terribly bright smile. It was very,61,6
1986,satisfactory to her to have an audience for this.,49,6
1987,,0,6
1988,"“And where are you going to be, Robert? It’s my own fault, all right.",69,6
1989,Perfectly my own fault. When I made you get rid of your little secretary,72,6
1990,on the magazine I ought to have known you’d get rid of me the same way.,71,6
1991,Jake doesn’t know about that. Should I tell him?”,49,6
1992,,0,6
1993,"“Shut up, Frances, for God’s sake.”",35,6
1994,,0,6
1995,"“Yes, I’ll tell him. Robert had a little secretary on the magazine. Just",72,6
1996,"the sweetest little thing in the world, and he thought she was",62,6
1997,"wonderful, and then I came along and he thought I was pretty wonderful,",71,6
1998,"too. So I made him get rid of her, and he had brought her to",60,6
1999,"Provincetown from Carmel when he moved the magazine, and he didn’t even",71,6
2000,pay her fare back to the coast. All to please me. He thought I was,66,6
2001,"pretty fine, then. Didn’t you, Robert?",38,6
2002,,0,6
2003,"“You mustn’t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the",69,6
2004,"secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that",70,6
2005,"she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that",72,6
2006,we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn’t that,63,6
2007,"literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.",71,6
2008,,0,6
2009,"“You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren’t you,",69,6
2010,Robert? That’s why he’s leaving me. He’s decided I don’t film well. You,71,6
2011,"see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing",70,6
2012,"on this book, that he doesn’t remember anything about us. So now he’s",69,6
2013,"going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something",67,6
2014,frightfully interesting.,24,6
2015,,0,6
2016,"“Listen, Robert, dear. Let me tell you something. You won’t mind, will",70,6
2017,you? Don’t have scenes with your young ladies. Try not to. Because you,70,6
2018,"can’t have scenes without crying, and then you pity yourself so much you",72,6
2019,can’t remember what the other person’s said. You’ll never be able to,68,6
2020,remember any conversations that way. Just try and be calm. I know it’s,70,6
2021,"awfully hard. But remember, it’s for literature. We all ought to make",69,6
2022,sacrifices for literature. Look at me. I’m going to England without a,69,6
2023,protest. All for literature. We must all help young writers. Don’t you,70,6
2024,"think so, Jake? But you’re not a young writer. Are you, Robert? You’re",70,6
2025,"thirty-four. Still, I suppose that is young for a great writer. Look at",71,6
2026,Hardy. Look at Anatole France. He just died a little while ago. Robert,70,6
2027,"doesn’t think he’s any good, though. Some of his French friends told",68,6
2028,him. He doesn’t read French very well himself. He wasn’t a good writer,70,6
2029,"like you are, was he, Robert? Do you think he ever had to go and look",69,6
2030,for material? What do you suppose he said to his mistresses when he,67,6
2031,"wouldn’t marry them? I wonder if he cried, too? Oh, I’ve just thought of",72,6
2032,something.” She put her gloved hand up to her lips. “I know the real,68,6
2033,"reason why Robert won’t marry me, Jake. It’s just come to me. They’ve",69,6
2034,sent it to me in a vision in the Café Select. Isn’t it mystic? Some day,71,6
2035,"they’ll put a tablet up. Like at Lourdes. Do you want to hear, Robert?",70,6
2036,I’ll tell you. It’s so simple. I wonder why I never thought about it.,69,6
2037,"Why, you see, Robert’s always wanted to have a mistress, and if he",66,6
2038,"doesn’t marry me, why, then he’s had one. She was his mistress for over",71,6
2039,"two years. See how it is? And if he marries me, like he’s always",64,6
2040,"promised he would, that would be the end of all the romance. Don’t you",70,6
2041,"think that’s bright of me to figure that out? It’s true, too. Look at",69,6
2042,"him and see if it’s not. Where are you going, Jake?”",52,6
2043,,0,6
2044,“I’ve got to go in and see Harvey Stone a minute.”,50,6
2045,,0,6
2046,Cohn looked up as I went in. His face was white. Why did he sit there?,70,6
2047,Why did he keep on taking it like that?,39,6
2048,,0,6
2049,As I stood against the bar looking out I could see them through the,67,6
2050,"window. Frances was talking on to him, smiling brightly, looking into",69,6
2051,"his face each time she asked: “Isn’t it so, Robert?” Or maybe she did",69,6
2052,not ask that now. Perhaps she said something else. I told the barman I,70,6
2053,did not want anything to drink and went out through the side door. As I,71,6
2054,went out the door I looked back through the two thicknesses of glass and,72,6
2055,saw them sitting there. She was still talking to him. I went down a side,72,6
2056,street to the Boulevard Raspail. A taxi came along and I got in and gave,72,6
2057,the driver the address of my flat.,34,6

2066,As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the,68,7
2067,"door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters",70,7
2068,and a telegram.,15,7
2069,,0,7
2070,“Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.”,57,7
2071,,0,7
2072,“Did she leave a card?”,23,7
2073,,0,7
2074,“No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night.,70,7
2075,In the end I find she is very nice.”,36,7
2076,,0,7
2077,“Was she with a friend of mine?”,32,7
2078,,0,7
2079,"“I don’t know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very",70,7
2080,"large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps,",71,7
2081,a little—” She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down.,66,7
2082,"“I’ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her",70,7
2083,not so gentille. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to,71,7
2084,"what I tell you. She is très, très gentille. She is of very good family.",72,7
2085,It is a thing you can see.”,27,7
2086,,0,7
2087,“They did not leave any word?”,30,7
2088,,0,7
2089,“Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.”,47,7
2090,,0,7
2091,“Send them up when they come.”,30,7
2092,,0,7
2093,"“Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is some one. An",69,7
2094,"eccentric, perhaps, but quelqu’une, quelqu’une!”",48,7
2095,,0,7
2096,"The concierge, before she became a concierge, had owned a drink-selling",71,7
2097,"concession at the Paris race-courses. Her life-work lay in the pelouse,",71,7
2098,"but she kept an eye on the people of the pesage, and she took great",67,7
2099,"pride in telling me which of my guests were well brought up, which were",71,7
2100,"of good family, who were sportsmen, a French word pronounced with the",69,7
2101,accent on the men. The only trouble was that people who did not fall,68,7
2102,into any of those three categories were very liable to be told there was,72,7
2103,"no one home, chez Barnes. One of my friends, an extremely",57,7
2104,"underfed-looking painter, who was obviously to Madame Duzinell neither",70,7
2105,"well brought up, of good family, nor a sportsman, wrote me a letter",67,7
2106,asking if I could get him a pass to get by the concierge so he could,68,7
2107,come up and see me occasionally in the evenings.,48,7
2108,,0,7
2109,I went up to the flat wondering what Brett had done to the concierge.,69,7
2110,"The wire was a cable from Bill Gorton, saying he was arriving on the",68,7
2111,"_France_. I put the mail on the table, went back to the bedroom,",64,7
2112,undressed and had a shower. I was rubbing down when I heard the,63,7
2113,door-bell pull. I put on a bathrobe and slippers and went to the door.,70,7
2114,It was Brett. Back of her was the count. He was holding a great bunch of,72,7
2115,roses.,6,7
2116,,0,7
2117,"“Hello, darling,” said Brett. “Aren’t you going to let us in?”",62,7
2118,,0,7
2119,“Come on. I was just bathing.”,30,7
2120,,0,7
2121,“Aren’t you the fortunate man. Bathing.”,40,7
2122,,0,7
2123,"“Only a shower. Sit down, Count Mippipopolous. What will you drink?”",68,7
2124,,0,7
2125,"“I don’t know whether you like flowers, sir,” the count said, “but I",68,7
2126,took the liberty of just bringing these roses.”,47,7
2127,,0,7
2128,"“Here, give them to me.” Brett took them. “Get me some water in this,",69,7
2129,"Jake.” I filled the big earthenware jug with water in the kitchen, and",70,7
2130,"Brett put the roses in it, and placed them in the centre of the",63,7
2131,dining-room table.,18,7
2132,,0,7
2133,“I say. We have had a day.”,27,7
2134,,0,7
2135,“You don’t remember anything about a date with me at the Crillon?”,66,7
2136,,0,7
2137,“No. Did we have one? I must have been blind.”,46,7
2138,,0,7
2139,"“You were quite drunk, my dear,” said the count.",48,7
2140,,0,7
2141,"“Wasn’t I, though? And the count’s been a brick, absolutely.”",61,7
2142,,0,7
2143,“You’ve got hell’s own drag with the concierge now.”,52,7
2144,,0,7
2145,“I ought to have. Gave her two hundred francs.”,47,7
2146,,0,7
2147,“Don’t be a damned fool.”,25,7
2148,,0,7
2149,"“His,” she said, and nodded at the count.",41,7
2150,,0,7
2151,“I thought we ought to give her a little something for last night. It,69,7
2152,was very late.”,15,7
2153,,0,7
2154,"“He’s wonderful,” Brett said. “He remembers everything that’s happened.”",72,7
2155,,0,7
2156,"“So do you, my dear.”",21,7
2157,,0,7
2158,"“Fancy,” said Brett. “Who’d want to? I say, Jake, _do_ we get a drink?”",71,7
2159,,0,7
2160,“You get it while I go in and dress. You know where it is.”,59,7
2161,,0,7
2162,“Rather.”,9,7
2163,,0,7
2164,"While I dressed I heard Brett put down glasses and then a siphon, and",69,7
2165,"then heard them talking. I dressed slowly, sitting on the bed. I felt",69,7
2166,"tired and pretty rotten. Brett came in the room, a glass in her hand,",69,7
2167,and sat on the bed.,19,7
2168,,0,7
2169,"“What’s the matter, darling? Do you feel rocky?”",48,7
2170,,0,7
2171,She kissed me coolly on the forehead.,37,7
2172,,0,7
2173,"“Oh, Brett, I love you so much.”",32,7
2174,,0,7
2175,"“Darling,” she said. Then: “Do you want me to send him away?”",61,7
2176,,0,7
2177,“No. He’s nice.”,16,7
2178,,0,7
2179,“I’ll send him away.”,21,7
2180,,0,7
2181,"“No, don’t.”",12,7
2182,,0,7
2183,"“Yes, I’ll send him away.”",26,7
2184,,0,7
2185,“You can’t just like that.”,27,7
2186,,0,7
2187,"“Can’t I, though? You stay here. He’s mad about me, I tell you.”",64,7
2188,,0,7
2189,She was gone out of the room. I lay face down on the bed. I was having a,72,7
2190,bad time. I heard them talking but I did not listen. Brett came in and,70,7
2191,sat on the bed.,15,7
2192,,0,7
2193,“Poor old darling.” She stroked my head.,40,7
2194,,0,7
2195,“What did you say to him?” I was lying with my face away from her. I did,72,7
2196,not want to see her.,20,7
2197,,0,7
2198,“Sent him for champagne. He loves to go for champagne.”,55,7
2199,,0,7
2200,"Then later: “Do you feel better, darling? Is the head any better?”",66,7
2201,,0,7
2202,“It’s better.”,14,7
2203,,0,7
2204,“Lie quiet. He’s gone to the other side of town.”,49,7
2205,,0,7
2206,"“Couldn’t we live together, Brett? Couldn’t we just live together?”",67,7
2207,,0,7
2208,“I don’t think so. I’d just _tromper_ you with everybody. You couldn’t,70,7
2209,stand it.”,10,7
2210,,0,7
2211,“I stand it now.”,17,7
2212,,0,7
2213,"“That would be different. It’s my fault, Jake. It’s the way I’m made.”",70,7
2214,,0,7
2215,“Couldn’t we go off in the country for a while?”,48,7
2216,,0,7
2217,“It wouldn’t be any good. I’ll go if you like. But I couldn’t live,66,7
2218,quietly in the country. Not with my own true love.”,51,7
2219,,0,7
2220,“I know.”,9,7
2221,,0,7
2222,“Isn’t it rotten? There isn’t any use my telling you I love you.”,65,7
2223,,0,7
2224,“You know I love you.”,22,7
2225,,0,7
2226,"“Let’s not talk. Talking’s all bilge. I’m going away from you, and then",71,7

2228,,0,7
2229,“Why are you going away?”,25,7
2230,,0,7

2232,,0,7
2233,“When are you going?”,21,7

2239,“San Sebastian.”,16,7
2240,,0,7
2241,“Can’t we go together?”,23,7
2242,,0,7
2243,“No. That would be a hell of an idea after we’d just talked it out.”,68,7
2244,,0,7
2245,“We never agreed.”,18,7
2246,,0,7
2247,"“Oh, you know as well as I do. Don’t be obstinate, darling.”",60,7
2248,,0,7
2249,"“Oh, sure,” I said. “I know you’re right. I’m just low, and when I’m low",72,7
2250,I talk like a fool.”,20,7
2251,,0,7
2252,"I sat up, leaned over, found my shoes beside the bed and put them on. I",71,7

2255,"“Don’t look like that, darling.”",32,7
2256,,0,7
2257,“How do you want me to look?”,29,7

2260,,0,7
2261,“To-morrow?”,12,7
2262,,0,7
2263,“Yes. Didn’t I say so? I am.”,29,7
2264,,0,7
2265,"“Let’s have a drink, then. The count will be back.”",51,7
2266,,0,7
2267,“Yes. He should be back. You know he’s extraordinary about buying,65,7
2268,champagne. It means any amount to him.”,39,7
2269,,0,7
2270,We went into the dining-room. I took up the brandy bottle and poured,68,7
2271,Brett a drink and one for myself. There was a ring at the bell-pull. I,70,7
2272,went to the door and there was the count. Behind him was the chauffeur,70,7
2273,carrying a basket of champagne.,31,7
2274,,0,7
2275,"“Where should I have him put it, sir?” asked the count.",55,7
2276,,0,7
2277,"“In the kitchen,” Brett said.",29,7
2278,,0,7
2279,"“Put it in there, Henry,” the count motioned. “Now go down and get the",70,7
2280,ice.” He stood looking after the basket inside the kitchen door. “I,67,7
2281,"think you’ll find that’s very good wine,” he said. “I know we don’t get",71,7
2282,"much of a chance to judge good wine in the States now, but I got this",69,7
2283,from a friend of mine that’s in the business.”,46,7
2284,,0,7
2285,"“Oh, you always have some one in the trade,” Brett said.",56,7
2286,,0,7
2287,“This fellow raises the grapes. He’s got thousands of acres of them.”,69,7
2288,,0,7
2289,“What’s his name?” asked Brett. “Veuve Cliquot?”,48,7
2290,,0,7
2291,"“No,” said the count. “Mumms. He’s a baron.”",44,7
2292,,0,7
2293,"“Isn’t it wonderful,” said Brett. “We all have titles. Why haven’t you a",72,7
2294,"title, Jake?”",13,7
2295,,0,7
2296,"“I assure you, sir,” the count put his hand on my arm. “It never does a",71,7
2297,man any good. Most of the time it costs you money.”,51,7
2298,,0,7
2299,"“Oh, I don’t know. It’s damned useful sometimes,” Brett said.",61,7
2300,,0,7
2301,“I’ve never known it to do me any good.”,40,7
2302,,0,7
2303,“You haven’t used it properly. I’ve had hell’s own amount of credit on,70,7
2304,mine.”,6,7
2305,,0,7
2306,"“Do sit down, count,” I said. “Let me take that stick.”",55,7
2307,,0,7
2308,The count was looking at Brett across the table under the gas-light. She,72,7
2309,was smoking a cigarette and flicking the ashes on the rug. She saw me,69,7
2310,"notice it. “I say, Jake, I don’t want to ruin your rugs. Can’t you give",71,7
2311,a chap an ash-tray?”,20,7
2312,,0,7
2313,I found some ash-trays and spread them around. The chauffeur came up,68,7
2314,"with a bucket full of salted ice. “Put two bottles in it, Henry,” the",69,7
2315,count called.,13,7
2316,,0,7
2317,"“Anything else, sir?”",21,7
2318,,0,7
2319,“No. Wait down in the car.” He turned to Brett and to me. “We’ll want to,72,7
2320,ride out to the Bois for dinner?”,33,7
2321,,0,7
2322,"“If you like,” Brett said. “I couldn’t eat a thing.”",52,7
2323,,0,7
2324,"“I always like a good meal,” said the count.",44,7
2325,,0,7
2326,"“Should I bring the wine in, sir?” asked the chauffeur.",55,7
2327,,0,7
2328,"“Yes. Bring it in, Henry,” said the count. He took out a heavy pigskin",70,7
2329,cigar-case and offered it to me. “Like to try a real American cigar?”,69,7
2330,,0,7
2331,"“Thanks,” I said. “I’ll finish the cigarette.”",46,7
2332,,0,7
2333,He cut off the end of his cigar with a gold cutter he wore on one end of,72,7
2334,his watch-chain.,16,7
2335,,0,7
2336,"“I like a cigar to really draw,” said the count “Half the cigars you",68,7
2337,smoke don’t draw.”,18,7
2338,,0,7
2339,"He lit the cigar, puffed at it, looking across the table at Brett. “And",71,7
2340,"when you’re divorced, Lady Ashley, then you won’t have a title.”",64,7
2341,,0,7
2342,“No. What a pity.”,18,7
2343,,0,7
2344,"“No,” said the count. “You don’t need a title. You got class all over",69,7
2345,you.”,5,7
2346,,0,7
2347,“Thanks. Awfully decent of you.”,32,7
2348,,0,7
2349,"“I’m not joking you,” the count blew a cloud of smoke. “You got the most",72,7
2350,class of anybody I ever seen. You got it. That’s all.”,54,7
2351,,0,7
2352,"“Nice of you,” said Brett. “Mummy would be pleased. Couldn’t you write",70,7
2353,"it out, and I’ll send it in a letter to her.”",45,7
2354,,0,7
2355,"“I’d tell her, too,” said the count. “I’m not joking you. I never joke",70,7
2356,people. Joke people and you make enemies. That’s what I always say.”,68,7
2357,,0,7
2358,"“You’re right,” Brett said. “You’re terribly right. I always joke people",72,7
2359,and I haven’t a friend in the world. Except Jake here.”,55,7
2360,,0,7
2361,“You don’t joke him.”,21,7
2362,,0,7
2363,“That’s it.”,12,7
2364,,0,7
2365,"“Do you, now?” asked the count. “Do you joke him?”",50,7
2366,,0,7
2367,Brett looked at me and wrinkled up the corners of her eyes.,59,7
2368,,0,7
2369,"“No,” she said. “I wouldn’t joke him.”",38,7
2370,,0,7
2371,"“See,” said the count. “You don’t joke him.”",44,7
2372,,0,7
2373,"“This is a hell of a dull talk,” Brett said. “How about some of that",68,7
2374,champagne?”,11,7
2375,,0,7
2376,The count reached down and twirled the bottles in the shiny bucket. “It,71,7
2377,"isn’t cold, yet. You’re always drinking, my dear. Why don’t you just",68,7
2378,talk?”,6,7
2379,,0,7
2380,“I’ve talked too ruddy much. I’ve talked myself all out to Jake.”,65,7
2381,,0,7

2383,never finish your sentences at all.”,36,7

2385,“Leave ’em for you to finish. Let any one finish them as they like.”,68,7
2386,,0,7
2387,"“It is a very interesting system,” the count reached down and gave the",70,7
2388,bottles a twirl. “Still I would like to hear you talk some time.”,65,7
2389,,0,7
2390,“Isn’t he a fool?” Brett asked.,31,7
2391,,0,7
2392,"“Now,” the count brought up a bottle. “I think this is cool.”",61,7
2393,,0,7
2394,I brought a towel and he wiped the bottle dry and held it up. “I like to,72,7
2395,drink champagne from magnums. The wine is better but it would have been,71,7
2396,"too hard to cool.” He held the bottle, looking at it. I put out the",67,7
2397,glasses.,8,7
2398,,0,7
2399,"“I say. You might open it,” Brett suggested.",44,7
2400,,0,7
2401,"“Yes, my dear. Now I’ll open it.”",33,7
2402,,0,7
2403,It was amazing champagne.,25,7
2404,,0,7
2405,"“I say that is wine,” Brett held up her glass. “We ought to toast",65,7
2406,something. ‘Here’s to royalty.’”,32,7
2407,,0,7
2408,"“This wine is too good for toast-drinking, my dear. You don’t want to",69,7

2690,looked back and there were three girls at his table. We got into the big,72,7
2691,car. Brett gave the chauffeur the address of her hotel.,55,7
2692,,0,7

2721,,0,8
2722,Nor did I see Robert Cohn again. I heard Frances had left for England,69,8
2723,and I had a note from Cohn saying he was going out in the country for a,71,8
2724,"couple of weeks, he did not know where, but that he wanted to hold me to",72,8
2725,the fishing-trip in Spain we had talked about last winter. I could reach,72,8

2727,,0,8
2728,"Brett was gone, I was not bothered by Cohn’s troubles, I rather enjoyed",71,8
2729,"not having to play tennis, there was plenty of work to do, I went often",71,8
2730,"to the races, dined with friends, and put in some extra time at the",67,8
2731,office getting things ahead so I could leave it in charge of my,63,8
2732,secretary when Bill Gorton and I should shove off to Spain the end of,69,8
2733,"June. Bill Gorton arrived, put up a couple of days at the flat and went",71,8
2734,off to Vienna. He was very cheerful and said the States were wonderful.,71,8
2735,New York was wonderful. There had been a grand theatrical season and a,70,8
2736,whole crop of great young light heavyweights. Any one of them was a good,72,8
2737,"prospect to grow up, put on weight and trim Dempsey. Bill was very",66,8
2738,"happy. He had made a lot of money on his last book, and was going to",68,8
2739,"make a lot more. We had a good time while he was in Paris, and then he",70,8
2740,went off to Vienna. He was coming back in three weeks and we would leave,72,8
2741,for Spain to get in some fishing and go to the fiesta at Pamplona. He,69,8
2742,"wrote that Vienna was wonderful. Then a card from Budapest: “Jake,",66,8
2743,Budapest is wonderful.” Then I got a wire: “Back on Monday.”,60,8
2744,,0,8
2745,Monday evening he turned up at the flat. I heard his taxi stop and went,71,8
2746,to the window and called to him; he waved and started up-stairs carrying,72,8

2908,“When did you see Harvey Stone?”,32,8
2909,,0,8
2910,“At the Crillon. Harvey was just a little daunted. Hadn’t eaten for,67,8

2937,"A taxi passed, some one in it waved, then banged for the driver to stop.",72,8

2944,“This is Bill Gorton. Lady Ashley.”,35,8

2949,"“Good. Come on and eat with us, and we’ll all go to meet him.”",62,8

2958,,0,8
2959,“Might do that. Now you’re not talking rot.”,44,8

2982,"“Vienna,” said Bill, “is a strange city.”",41,8

2987,"“Exactly,” Bill said. “Very much like Paris at this moment.”",60,8
2988,,0,8
2989,“You _have_ a good start.”,26,8
2990,,0,8
2991,Sitting out on the terraces of the Lilas Brett ordered a whiskey and,68,8

3033,,0,8
3034,“Good.”,7,8

3047,"“Well, well,” Bill said. “That’s always just the stage I meet anybody.",70,8

3050,“We better eat.”,16,8
3051,,0,8
3052,“Is she really Lady something or other?” Bill asked in the taxi on our,70,8

3056,,0,8
3057,"“Well, well.”",13,8
3058,,0,8
3059,We ate dinner at Madame Lecomte’s restaurant on the far side of the,67,8
3060,island. It was crowded with Americans and we had to stand up and wait,69,8
3061,for a place. Some one had put it in the American Women’s Club list as a,71,8
3062,"quaint restaurant on the Paris quais as yet untouched by Americans, so",70,8
3063,we had to wait forty-five minutes for a table. Bill had eaten at the,68,8
3064,"restaurant in 1918, and right after the armistice, and Madame Lecomte",69,8
3065,made a great fuss over seeing him.,34,8
3066,,0,8
3067,"“Doesn’t get us a table, though,” Bill said. “Grand woman, though.”",67,8
3068,,0,8
3069,"We had a good meal, a roast chicken, new green beans, mashed potatoes, a",72,8
3070,"salad, and some apple-pie and cheese.",37,8
3071,,0,8
3072,"“You’ve got the world here all right,” Bill said to Madame Lecomte. She",71,8

3074,,0,8
3075,“You’ll be rich.”,17,8
3076,,0,8
3077,“I hope so.”,12,8
3078,,0,8
3079,"After the coffee and a _fine_ we got the bill, chalked up the same as",69,8
3080,"ever on a slate, that was doubtless one of the “quaint” features, paid",70,8
3081,"it, shook hands, and went out.",30,8
3082,,0,8
3083,"“You never come here any more, Monsieur Barnes,” Madame Lecomte said.",69,8
3084,,0,8
3085,“Too many compatriots.”,23,8
3086,,0,8
3087,“Come at lunch-time. It’s not crowded then.”,44,8
3088,,0,8
3089,“Good. I’ll be down soon.”,26,8
3090,,0,8
3091,We walked along under the trees that grew out over the river on the Quai,72,8
3092,d’Orléans side of the island. Across the river were the broken walls of,71,8
3093,old houses that were being torn down.,37,8
3094,,0,8
3095,“They’re going to cut a street through.”,40,8
3096,,0,8
3097,"“They would,” Bill said.",24,8
3098,,0,8
3099,We walked on and circled the island. The river was dark and a bateau,68,8
3100,"mouche went by, all bright with lights, going fast and quiet up and out",71,8
3101,of sight under the bridge. Down the river was Notre Dame squatting,66,8
3102,against the night sky. We crossed to the left bank of the Seine by the,70,8
3103,"wooden foot-bridge from the Quai de Bethune, and stopped on the bridge",70,8
3104,and looked down the river at Notre Dame. Standing on the bridge the,67,8
3105,"island looked dark, the houses were high against the sky, and the trees",71,8
3106,were shadows.,13,8
3107,,0,8
3108,"“It’s pretty grand,” Bill said. “God, I love to get back.”",58,8
3109,,0,8
3110,We leaned on the wooden rail of the bridge and looked up the river to,69,8
3111,the lights of the big bridges. Below the water was smooth and black. It,71,8
3112,made no sound against the piles of the bridge. A man and a girl passed,70,8
3113,us. They were walking with their arms around each other.,56,8
3114,,0,8
3115,We crossed the bridge and walked up the Rue du Cardinal Lemoine. It was,71,8
3116,"steep walking, and we went all the way up to the Place Contrescarpe. The",72,8
3117,"arc-light shone through the leaves of the trees in the square, and",66,8
3118,underneath the trees was an S bus ready to start. Music came out of the,71,8
3119,door of the Negre Joyeux. Through the window of the Café Aux Amateurs I,71,8
3120,saw the long zinc bar. Outside on the terrace working people were,65,8
3121,drinking. In the open kitchen of the Amateurs a girl was cooking,64,8
3122,potato-chips in oil. There was an iron pot of stew. The girl ladled some,72,8
3123,onto a plate for an old man who stood holding a bottle of red wine in,69,8
3124,one hand.,9,8
3125,,0,8
3126,“Want to have a drink?”,23,8
3127,,0,8
3128,"“No,” said Bill. “I don’t need it.”",35,8
3129,,0,8
3130,"We turned to the right off the Place Contrescarpe, walking along smooth",71,8
3131,narrow streets with high old houses on both sides. Some of the houses,69,8
3132,jutted out toward the street. Others were cut back. We came onto the Rue,72,8
3133,du Pot de Fer and followed it along until it brought us to the rigid,68,8
3134,"north and south of the Rue Saint Jacques and then walked south, past Val",72,8
3135,"de Grâce, set back behind the courtyard and the iron fence, to the",66,8
3136,Boulevard du Port Royal.,24,8
3137,,0,8

3141,“Why not?”,10,8
3142,,0,8
3143,"We walked along Port Royal until it became Montparnasse, and then on",68,8

3145,"the street to the Rotonde, past its lights and tables to the Select.",68,8

3153,,0,8

3155,long. One drink a day with my mother at tea.”,45,8
3156,,0,8
3157,"Bill had gone into the bar. He was standing talking with Brett, who was",71,8

3160,"“It’s good to see you, Jake,” Michael said. “I’m a little tight you",67,8

3162,,0,8
3163,There was a patch of dried blood on the bridge of his nose.,59,8
3164,,0,8
3165,"“An old lady’s bags did that,” Mike said. “I reached up to help her with",72,8

3181,,0,8
3182,She turned to Mike. “This is Bill Gorton. This drunkard is Mike,63,8

3211,"“He’s very good, Ledoux,” Mike said. “I’d like to see it, rather”—he",68,8

3214,,0,8

3247,The Ledoux-Kid Francis fight was the night of the 20th of June. It was a,72,9
3248,"good fight. The morning after the fight I had a letter from Robert Cohn,",72,9
3249,"written from Hendaye. He was having a very quiet time, he said, bathing,",72,9
3250,"playing some golf and much bridge. Hendaye had a splendid beach, but he",71,9

3254,That same morning I wrote Cohn from the office that Bill and I would,68,9

3425,We would all meet at the Montoya in Pamplona. If they did not turn up on,72,9
3426,Monday at the latest we would go on ahead up to Burguete in the,63,9

3428,itinerary so they could follow us.,34,9
3429,,0,9
3430,Bill and I took the morning train from the Gare d’Orsay. It was a lovely,72,9
3431,"day, not too hot, and the country was beautiful from the start. We went",71,9
3432,back into the diner and had breakfast. Leaving the dining-car I asked,69,9

3452,,0,9
3453,"“Thank you,” he said. “I would advise you gentlemen to get some",63,9

3457,"“You’ll go a long way, brother,” Bill said to him in English. “I suppose",72,9

3478,"“You could have come over ten years ago, if you’d wanted to,” the wife",70,9

3481,,0,9
3482,"“Say, there’s plenty of Americans on this train,” the husband said.",67,9

3486,"“So, that’s what they are. Pilgrims. Goddam Puritans,” Bill said.",65,9

3495,,0,9
3496,"“Well, I never cared for it, myself. There’s plenty that do out where I",71,9
3497,"come from, though. We got some of the best fishing in the State of",66,9
3498,"Montana. I’ve been out with the boys, but I never cared for it any.”",68,9
3499,,0,9
3500,"“Mighty little fishing you did on them trips,” his wife said.",61,9
3501,,0,9
3502,He winked at us.,16,9
3503,,0,9
3504,"“You know how the ladies are. If there’s a jug goes along, or a case of",71,9
3505,"beer, they think it’s hell and damnation.”",42,9
3506,,0,9
3507,"“That’s the way men are,” his wife said to us. She smoothed her",63,9
3508,"comfortable lap. “I voted against prohibition to please him, and because",72,9
3509,"I like a little beer in the house, and then he talks that way. It’s a",69,9
3510,wonder they ever find any one to marry them.”,45,9
3511,,0,9
3512,"“Say,” said Bill, “do you know that gang of Pilgrim Fathers have",64,9
3513,cornered the dining-car until half past three this afternoon?”,62,9
3514,,0,9
3515,“How do you mean? They can’t do a thing like that.”,51,9

3517,“You try and get seats.”,24,9

3523,,0,9
3524,"“Will you boys keep an eye on our things? Come on, Hubert.”",59,9
3525,,0,9
3526,They all three went up to the wagon restaurant. A little while after,68,9
3527,"they were gone a steward went through announcing the first service, and",71,9
3528,"pilgrims, with their priests, commenced filing down the corridor. Our",69,9
3529,friend and his family did not come back. A waiter passed in the corridor,72,9
3530,"with our sandwiches and the bottle of Chablis, and we called him in.",68,9
3531,,0,9
3532,"“You’re going to work to-day,” I said.",38,9
3533,,0,9
3534,"He nodded his head. “They start now, at ten-thirty.”",52,9
3535,,0,9
3536,“When do we eat?”,17,9
3537,,0,9
3538,“Huh! When do I eat?”,21,9
3539,,0,9
3540,"He left two glasses for the bottle, and we paid him for the sandwiches",70,9
3541,and tipped him.,15,9
3542,,0,9
3543,"“I’ll get the plates,” he said, “or bring them with you.”",57,9
3544,,0,9
3545,We ate the sandwiches and drank the Chablis and watched the country out,71,9
3546,of the window. The grain was just beginning to ripen and the fields were,72,9
3547,"full of poppies. The pastureland was green, and there were fine trees,",70,9
3548,and sometimes big rivers and chateaux off in the trees.,55,9
3549,,0,9
3550,"At Tours we got off and bought another bottle of wine, and when we got",70,9
3551,back in the compartment the gentleman from Montana and his wife and his,71,9
3552,"son, Hubert, were sitting comfortably.",38,9
3553,,0,9
3554,“Is there good swimming in Biarritz?” asked Hubert.,51,9
3555,,0,9
3556,"“That boy’s just crazy till he can get in the water,” his mother said.",70,9
3557,“It’s pretty hard on youngsters travelling.”,44,9
3558,,0,9
3559,"“There’s good swimming,” I said. “But it’s dangerous when it’s rough.”",70,9
3560,,0,9
3561,“Did you get a meal?” Bill asked.,33,9
3562,,0,9
3563,"“We sure did. We set right there when they started to come in, and they",71,9
3564,must have just thought we were in the party. One of the waiters said,68,9
3565,"something to us in French, and then they just sent three of them back.”",71,9
3566,,0,9
3567,"“They thought we were snappers, all right,” the man said. “It certainly",71,9
3568,shows you the power of the Catholic Church. It’s a pity you boys ain’t,70,9
3569,"Catholics. You could get a meal, then, all right.”",50,9
3570,,0,9
3571,"“I am,” I said. “That’s what makes me so sore.”",47,9
3572,,0,9
3573,Finally at a quarter past four we had lunch. Bill had been rather,65,9
3574,difficult at the last. He buttonholed a priest who was coming back with,71,9
3575,one of the returning streams of pilgrims.,41,9
3576,,0,9
3577,"“When do us Protestants get a chance to eat, father?”",53,9
3578,,0,9
3579,“I don’t know anything about it. Haven’t you got tickets?”,58,9
3580,,0,9
3581,"“It’s enough to make a man join the Klan,” Bill said. The priest looked",71,9
3582,back at him.,12,9
3583,,0,9
3584,Inside the dining-car the waiters served the fifth successive table,67,9
3585,d’hôte meal. The waiter who served us was soaked through. His white,67,9
3586,jacket was purple under the arms.,33,9
3587,,0,9
3588,“He must drink a lot of wine.”,30,9
3589,,0,9
3590,“Or wear purple undershirts.”,29,9
3591,,0,9
3592,“Let’s ask him.”,16,9
3593,,0,9
3594,“No. He’s too tired.”,21,9
3595,,0,9
3596,The train stopped for half an hour at Bordeaux and we went out through,70,9
3597,the station for a little walk. There was not time to get in to the town.,72,9
3598,Afterward we passed through the Landes and watched the sun set. There,69,9
3599,"were wide fire-gaps cut through the pines, and you could look up them",69,9
3600,like avenues and see wooded hills way off. About seven-thirty we had,68,9
3601,dinner and watched the country through the open window in the diner. It,71,9
3602,was all sandy pine country full of heather. There were little clearings,71,9
3603,"with houses in them, and once in a while we passed a sawmill. It got",68,9
3604,dark and we could feel the country hot and sandy and dark outside of the,72,9
3605,"window, and about nine o’clock we got into Bayonne. The man and his wife",72,9
3606,and Hubert all shook hands with us. They were going on to LaNegresse to,71,9
3607,change for Biarritz.,20,9
3608,,0,9
3609,"“Well, I hope you have lots of luck,” he said.",46,9
3610,,0,9
3611,“Be careful about those bull-fights.”,37,9
3612,,0,9
3613,"“Maybe we’ll see you at Biarritz,” Hubert said.",47,9
3614,,0,9
3615,We got off with our bags and rod-cases and passed through the dark,66,9
3616,station and out to the lights and the line of cabs and hotel buses.,67,9
3617,"There, standing with the hotel runners, was Robert Cohn. He did not see",71,9
3618,us at first. Then he started forward.,37,9
3619,,0,9
3620,"“Hello, Jake. Have a good trip?”",32,9
3621,,0,9
3622,"“Fine,” I said. “This is Bill Gorton.”",38,9
3623,,0,9
3624,“How are you?”,14,9
3625,,0,9
3626,"“Come on,” said Robert. “I’ve got a cab.” He was a little near-sighted.",71,9
3627,"I had never noticed it before. He was looking at Bill, trying to make",69,9
3628,"him out. He was shy, too.",25,9
3629,,0,9
3630,“We’ll go up to my hotel. It’s all right. It’s quite nice.”,59,9
3631,,0,9
3632,"We got into the cab, and the cabman put the bags up on the seat beside",70,9
3633,"him and climbed up and cracked his whip, and we drove over the dark",67,9
3634,bridge and into the town.,25,9
3635,,0,9
3636,"“I’m awfully glad to meet you,” Robert said to Bill. “I’ve heard so much",72,9
3637,"about you from Jake and I’ve read your books. Did you get my line,",66,9
3638,Jake?”,6,9
3639,,0,9
3640,The cab stopped in front of the hotel and we all got out and went in. It,72,9
3641,"was a nice hotel, and the people at the desk were very cheerful, and we",71,9
3642,each had a good small room.,27,9
3643,,0,9
3644,,0,9

3650,,0,10
3651,"In the morning it was bright, and they were sprinkling the streets of",69,10
3652,"the town, and we all had breakfast in a café. Bayonne is a nice town. It",72,10
3653,"is like a very clean Spanish town and it is on a big river. Already, so",71,10
3654,"early in the morning, it was very hot on the bridge across the river. We",72,10
3655,walked out on the bridge and then took a walk through the town.,63,10
3656,,0,10
3657,"I was not at all sure Mike’s rods would come from Scotland in time, so",70,10
3658,we hunted a tackle store and finally bought a rod for Bill up-stairs,68,10
3659,"over a drygoods store. The man who sold the tackle was out, and we had",70,10
3660,"to wait for him to come back. Finally he came in, and we bought a pretty",72,10
3661,"good rod cheap, and two landing-nets.",37,10
3662,,0,10
3663,We went out into the street again and took a look at the cathedral. Cohn,72,10
3664,made some remark about it being a very good example of something or,67,10
3665,"other, I forget what. It seemed like a nice cathedral, nice and dim,",68,10
3666,like Spanish churches. Then we went up past the old fort and out to the,71,10
3667,"local Syndicat d’Initiative office, where the bus was supposed to start",71,10
3668,from. There they told us the bus service did not start until the 1st of,71,10
3669,July. We found out at the tourist office what we ought to pay for a,67,10
3670,motor-car to Pamplona and hired one at a big garage just around the,67,10
3671,corner from the Municipal Theatre for four hundred francs. The car was,70,10
3672,"to pick us up at the hotel in forty minutes, and we stopped at the café",71,10
3673,"on the square where we had eaten breakfast, and had a beer. It was hot,",71,10
3674,"but the town had a cool, fresh, early-morning smell and it was pleasant",71,10
3675,"sitting in the café. A breeze started to blow, and you could feel that",70,10
3676,"the air came from the sea. There were pigeons out in the square, and the",72,10
3677,"houses were a yellow, sun-baked color, and I did not want to leave the",70,10
3678,café. But we had to go to the hotel to get our bags packed and pay the,70,10
3679,"bill. We paid for the beers, we matched and I think Cohn paid, and went",71,10
3680,"up to the hotel. It was only sixteen francs apiece for Bill and me, with",72,10
3681,"ten per cent added for the service, and we had the bags sent down and",69,10
3682,waited for Robert Cohn. While we were waiting I saw a cockroach on the,70,10
3683,parquet floor that must have been at least three inches long. I pointed,71,10
3684,him out to Bill and then put my shoe on him. We agreed he must have just,72,10
3685,come in from the garden. It was really an awfully clean hotel.,62,10
3686,,0,10
3687,"Cohn came down, finally, and we all went out to the car. It was a big,",70,10
3688,"closed car, with a driver in a white duster with blue collar and cuffs,",71,10
3689,and we had him put the back of the car down. He piled in the bags and we,72,10
3690,started off up the street and out of the town. We passed some lovely,68,10
3691,"gardens and had a good look back at the town, and then we were out in",69,10
3692,"the country, green and rolling, and the road climbing all the time. We",70,10
3693,"passed lots of Basques with oxen, or cattle, hauling carts along the",68,10
3694,"road, and nice farmhouses, low roofs, and all white-plastered. In the",69,10
3695,Basque country the land all looks very rich and green and the houses and,72,10
3696,villages look well-off and clean. Every village had a pelota court and,70,10
3697,on some of them kids were playing in the hot sun. There were signs on,69,10
3698,the walls of the churches saying it was forbidden to play pelota against,72,10
3699,"them, and the houses in the villages had red tiled roofs, and then the",70,10
3700,road turned off and commenced to climb and we were going way up close,69,10
3701,"along a hillside, with a valley below and hills stretched off back",66,10
3702,toward the sea. You couldn’t see the sea. It was too far away. You could,72,10
3703,"see only hills and more hills, and you knew where the sea was.",62,10
3704,,0,10
3705,"We crossed the Spanish frontier. There was a little stream and a bridge,",72,10
3706,"and Spanish carabineers, with patent-leather Bonaparte hats, and short",70,10
3707,"guns on their backs, on one side, and on the other fat Frenchmen in",67,10
3708,kepis and mustaches. They only opened one bag and took the passports in,71,10
3709,and looked at them. There was a general store and inn on each side of,69,10
3710,the line. The chauffeur had to go in and fill out some papers about the,71,10
3711,car and we got out and went over to the stream to see if there were any,71,10
3712,"trout. Bill tried to talk some Spanish to one of the carabineers, but it",72,10
3713,"did not go very well. Robert Cohn asked, pointing with his finger, if",69,10
3714,"there were any trout in the stream, and the carabineer said yes, but not",72,10
3715,many.,5,10
3716,,0,10

3720,"Just then an old man with long, sunburned hair and beard, and clothes",69,10
3721,"that looked as though they were made of gunny-sacking, came striding up",71,10
3722,"to the bridge. He was carrying a long staff, and he had a kid slung on",70,10
3723,"his back, tied by the four legs, the head hanging down.",55,10
3724,,0,10
3725,The carabineer waved him back with his sword. The man turned without,68,10
3726,"saying anything, and started back up the white road into Spain.",63,10

3744,"The chauffeur came out, folding up the papers and putting them in the",69,10
3745,inside pocket of his coat. We all got in the car and it started up the,70,10
3746,white dusty road into Spain. For a while the country was much as it had,71,10
3747,"been; then, climbing all the time, we crossed the top of a Col, the road",72,10
3748,"winding back and forth on itself, and then it was really Spain. There",69,10
3749,were long brown mountains and a few pines and far-off forests of,64,10
3750,beech-trees on some of the mountainsides. The road went along the summit,72,10
3751,"of the Col and then dropped down, and the driver had to honk, and slow",70,10
3752,"up, and turn out to avoid running into two donkeys that were sleeping in",72,10
3753,"the road. We came down out of the mountains and through an oak forest,",70,10
3754,and there were white cattle grazing in the forest. Down below there were,72,10
3755,"grassy plains and clear streams, and then we crossed a stream and went",70,10
3756,"through a gloomy little village, and started to climb again. We climbed",71,10
3757,"up and up and crossed another high Col and turned along it, and the road",72,10
3758,"ran down to the right, and we saw a whole new range of mountains off to",71,10
3759,"the south, all brown and baked-looking and furrowed in strange shapes.",70,10
3760,,0,10
3761,"After a while we came out of the mountains, and there were trees along",70,10
3762,"both sides of the road, and a stream and ripe fields of grain, and the",70,10
3763,"road went on, very white and straight ahead, and then lifted to a little",72,10
3764,"rise, and off on the left was a hill with an old castle, with buildings",71,10
3765,close around it and a field of grain going right up to the walls and,68,10
3766,shifting in the wind. I was up in front with the driver and I turned,68,10
3767,"around. Robert Cohn was asleep, but Bill looked and nodded his head.",68,10
3768,"Then we crossed a wide plain, and there was a big river off on the right",72,10
3769,"shining in the sun from between the line of trees, and away off you",67,10
3770,"could see the plateau of Pamplona rising out of the plain, and the walls",72,10
3771,"of the city, and the great brown cathedral, and the broken skyline of",69,10
3772,"the other churches. In back of the plateau were the mountains, and every",72,10
3773,"way you looked there were other mountains, and ahead the road stretched",71,10
3774,out white across the plain going toward Pamplona.,49,10
3775,,0,10
3776,"We came into the town on the other side of the plateau, the road",64,10
3777,"slanting up steeply and dustily with shade-trees on both sides, and then",72,10
3778,levelling out through the new part of town they are building up outside,71,10
3779,"the old walls. We passed the bull-ring, high and white and",58,10
3780,"concrete-looking in the sun, and then came into the big square by a side",72,10
3781,street and stopped in front of the Hotel Montoya.,49,10
3782,,0,10
3783,The driver helped us down with the bags. There was a crowd of kids,66,10
3784,"watching the car, and the square was hot, and the trees were green, and",71,10
3785,"the flags hung on their staffs, and it was good to get out of the sun",69,10
3786,and under the shade of the arcade that runs all the way around the,66,10
3787,"square. Montoya was glad to see us, and shook hands and gave us good",68,10
3788,"rooms looking out on the square, and then we washed and cleaned up and",70,10
3789,went down-stairs in the dining-room for lunch. The driver stayed for,68,10
3790,"lunch, too, and afterward we paid him and he started back to Bayonne.",69,10
3791,,0,10
3792,There are two dining-rooms in the Montoya. One is up-stairs on the,66,10
3793,second floor and looks out on the square. The other is down one floor,69,10
3794,below the level of the square and has a door that opens on the back,67,10
3795,street that the bulls pass along when they run through the streets early,72,10
3796,in the morning on their way to the ring. It is always cool in the,65,10
3797,down-stairs dining-room and we had a very good lunch. The first meal in,71,10
3798,"Spain was always a shock with the hors d’œuvres, an egg course, two meat",72,10
3799,"courses, vegetables, salad, and dessert and fruit. You have to drink",68,10
3800,plenty of wine to get it all down. Robert Cohn tried to say he did not,70,10
3801,"want any of the second meat course, but we would not interpret for him,",71,10
3802,"and so the waitress brought him something else as a replacement, a plate",72,10
3803,"of cold meats, I think. Cohn had been rather nervous ever since we had",70,10
3804,met at Bayonne. He did not know whether we knew Brett had been with him,71,10
3805,"at San Sebastian, and it made him rather awkward.",49,10

3861,"“The barber shop’s closed,” Cohn said. “It’s not open till four.”",65,10
3862,,0,10
3863,"We had coffee at the Iruña, sitting in comfortable wicker chairs looking",72,10
3864,out from the cool of the arcade at the big square. After a while Bill,69,10
3865,went to write some letters and Cohn went over to the barber-shop. It was,72,10
3866,"still closed, so he decided to go up to the hotel and get a bath, and I",71,10
3867,sat out in front of the café and then went for a walk in the town. It,69,10
3868,"was very hot, but I kept on the shady side of the streets and went",66,10
3869,through the market and had a good time seeing the town again. I went to,71,10
3870,the Ayuntamiento and found the old gentleman who subscribes for the,67,10
3871,"bull-fight tickets for me every year, and he had gotten the money I sent",72,10
3872,"him from Paris and renewed my subscriptions, so that was all set. He was",72,10
3873,"the archivist, and all the archives of the town were in his office. That",72,10
3874,"has nothing to do with the story. Anyway, his office had a green baize",70,10
3875,"door and a big wooden door, and when I went out I left him sitting among",72,10
3876,"the archives that covered all the walls, and I shut both the doors, and",71,10
3877,as I went out of the building into the street the porter stopped me to,70,10
3878,brush off my coat.,18,10

3880,"“You must have been in a motor-car,” he said.",45,10

3886,,0,10
3887,"“Well, well,” he said. “I knew you were in a motor-car from the way the",71,10

3889,,0,10
3890,At the end of the street I saw the cathedral and walked up toward it.,69,10
3891,The first time I ever saw it I thought the façade was ugly but I liked,70,10
3892,"it now. I went inside. It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up,",72,10
3893,"and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were",70,10
3894,some wonderful big windows. I knelt and started to pray and prayed for,70,10
3895,"everybody I thought of, Brett and Mike and Bill and Robert Cohn and",67,10
3896,"myself, and all the bull-fighters, separately for the ones I liked, and",71,10
3897,"lumping all the rest, then I prayed for myself again, and while I was",69,10
3898,"praying for myself I found I was getting sleepy, so I prayed that the",69,10
3899,"bull-fights would be good, and that it would be a fine fiesta, and that",71,10
3900,we would get some fishing. I wondered if there was anything else I might,72,10
3901,"pray for, and I thought I would like to have some money, so I prayed",68,10
3902,"that I would make a lot of money, and then I started to think how I",67,10
3903,"would make it, and thinking of making money reminded me of the count,",69,10
3904,"and I started wondering about where he was, and regretting I hadn’t seen",72,10
3905,"him since that night in Montmartre, and about something funny Brett told",72,10
3906,"me about him, and as all the time I was kneeling with my forehead on the",72,10
3907,"wood in front of me, and was thinking of myself as praying, I was a",67,10
3908,"little ashamed, and regretted that I was such a rotten Catholic, but",68,10
3909,"realized there was nothing I could do about it, at least for a while,",69,10
3910,"and maybe never, but that anyway it was a grand religion, and I only",68,10
3911,wished I felt religious and maybe I would the next time; and then I was,71,10
3912,"out in the hot sun on the steps of the cathedral, and the forefingers",69,10
3913,"and the thumb of my right hand were still damp, and I felt them dry in",70,10
3914,"the sun. The sunlight was hot and hard, and I crossed over beside some",70,10
3915,"buildings, and walked back along side-streets to the hotel.",59,10
3916,,0,10
3917,"At dinner that night we found that Robert Cohn had taken a bath, had had",72,10
3918,"a shave and a haircut and a shampoo, and something put on his hair",66,10
3919,"afterward to make it stay down. He was nervous, and I did not try to",68,10
3920,"help him any. The train was due in at nine o’clock from San Sebastian,",70,10
3921,"and, if Brett and Mike were coming, they would be on it. At twenty",66,10
3922,minutes to nine we were not half through dinner. Robert Cohn got up from,72,10
3923,the table and said he would go to the station. I said I would go with,69,10
3924,"him, just to devil him. Bill said he would be damned if he would leave",70,10
3925,his dinner. I said we would be right back.,42,10
3926,,0,10
3927,We walked to the station. I was enjoying Cohn’s nervousness. I hoped,68,10
3928,"Brett would be on the train. At the station the train was late, and we",70,10
3929,sat on a baggage-truck and waited outside in the dark. I have never seen,72,10
3930,a man in civil life as nervous as Robert Cohn—nor as eager. I was,65,10
3931,"enjoying it. It was lousy to enjoy it, but I felt lousy. Cohn had a",67,10

3936,went inside the station and stood with a crowd of people just back of,69,10

3938,coming out through the gates.,29,10
3939,,0,10
3940,They were not in the crowd. We waited till everybody had gone through,69,10

3979,Why I felt that impulse to devil him I do not know. Of course I do know.,72,10
3980,"I was blind, unforgivingly jealous of what had happened to him. The fact",72,10

4166,"Bill to save a place for me, and I went back in the hotel to get a",66,11
4167,couple of bottles of wine to take with us. When I came out the bus was,70,11
4168,"crowded. Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top,",72,11

4174,Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the,71,11

4176,"wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he",64,11
4177,imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that I,72,11
4178,"spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made",71,11
4179,"me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it",70,11
4180,fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it.,72,11
4181,The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not,67,11
4182,"getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man",69,11
4183,waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at,66,11
4184,lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long,66,11
4185,"drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus. Every one",72,11
4186,"took a drink very politely, and then they made us cork it up and put it",71,11
4187,away. They all wanted us to drink from their leather wine-bottles. They,71,11
4188,were peasants going up into the hills.,38,11

4190,"Finally, after a couple more false klaxons, the bus started, and Robert",71,11

4193,nice riding high up and close under the trees. The bus went quite fast,70,11
4194,"and made a good breeze, and as we went out along the road with the dust",71,11
4195,"powdering the trees and down the hill, we had a fine view, back through",71,11
4196,"the trees, of the town rising up from the bluff above the river. The",68,11
4197,Basque lying against my knees pointed out the view with the neck of the,71,11

4204,The Basque lying against my legs was tanned the color of saddle-leather.,72,11
4205,He wore a black smock like all the rest. There were wrinkles in his,67,11

4207,handed him one of our bottles. The Basque wagged a forefinger at him and,72,11

4209,He shoved the wine-bag up.,26,11

4215,leather bottle down a few drops ran down his chin.,50,11
4216,,0,11
4217,“No! No!” several Basques said. “Not like that.” One snatched the bottle,72,11
4218,"away from the owner, who was himself about to give a demonstration. He",70,11
4219,was a young fellow and he held the wine-bottle at full arms’ length and,71,11
4220,"raised it high up, squeezing the leather bag with his hand so the stream",72,11
4221,"of wine hissed into his mouth. He held the bag out there, the wine",66,11
4222,"making a flat, hard trajectory into his mouth, and he kept on swallowing",72,11
4223,smoothly and regularly.,23,11
4224,,0,11
4225,“Hey!” the owner of the bottle shouted. “Whose wine is that?”,61,11

4232,"We passed through a town and stopped in front of the posada, and the",68,11
4233,"driver took on several packages. Then we started on again, and outside",70,11
4234,the town the road commenced to mount. We were going through farming,67,11
4235,country with rocky hills that sloped down into the fields. The,62,11
4236,grain-fields went up the hillsides. Now as we went higher there was a,69,11
4237,"wind blowing the grain. The road was white and dusty, and the dust rose",71,11
4238,under the wheels and hung in the air behind us. The road climbed up into,72,11
4239,the hills and left the rich grain-fields below. Now there were only,67,11
4240,patches of grain on the bare hillsides and on each side of the,62,11
4241,water-courses. We turned sharply out to the side of the road to give,68,11
4242,"room to pass to a long string of six mules, following one after the",67,11
4243,"other, hauling a high-hooded wagon loaded with freight. The wagon and",69,11
4244,the mules were covered with dust. Close behind was another string of,68,11
4245,"mules and another wagon. This was loaded with lumber, and the arriero",69,11
4246,driving the mules leaned back and put on the thick wooden brakes as we,70,11
4247,passed. Up here the country was quite barren and the hills were rocky,69,11
4248,and hard-baked clay furrowed by the rain.,41,11
4249,,0,11
4250,"We came around a curve into a town, and on both sides opened out a",66,11
4251,sudden green valley. A stream went through the centre of the town and,69,11
4252,fields of grapes touched the houses.,36,11
4253,,0,11
4254,The bus stopped in front of a posada and many of the passengers got,67,11
4255,"down, and a lot of the baggage was unstrapped from the roof from under",70,11
4256,the big tarpaulins and lifted down. Bill and I got down and went into,69,11
4257,"the posada. There was a low, dark room with saddles and harness, and",68,11
4258,"hay-forks made of white wood, and clusters of canvas rope-soled shoes",69,11
4259,and hams and slabs of bacon and white garlics and long sausages hanging,71,11
4260,"from the roof. It was cool and dusky, and we stood in front of a long",69,11
4261,wooden counter with two women behind it serving drinks. Behind them were,72,11
4262,shelves stacked with supplies and goods.,40,11
4263,,0,11
4264,We each had an aguardiente and paid forty centimes for the two drinks. I,72,11
4265,"gave the woman fifty centimes to make a tip, and she gave me back the",69,11
4266,"copper piece, thinking I had misunderstood the price.",53,11
4267,,0,11
4268,Two of our Basques came in and insisted on buying a drink. So they,66,11
4269,"bought a drink and then we bought a drink, and then they slapped us on",70,11
4270,"the back and bought another drink. Then we bought, and then we all went",71,11
4271,"out into the sunlight and the heat, and climbed back on top of the bus.",71,11
4272,"There was plenty of room now for every one to sit on the seat, and the",70,11
4273,Basque who had been lying on the tin roof now sat between us. The woman,71,11
4274,who had been serving drinks came out wiping her hands on her apron and,70,11
4275,talked to somebody inside the bus. Then the driver came out swinging two,72,11
4276,"flat leather mail-pouches and climbed up, and everybody waving we",65,11
4277,started off.,12,11
4278,,0,11
4279,"The road left the green valley at once, and we were up in the hills",67,11
4280,again. Bill and the wine-bottle Basque were having a conversation. A man,72,11
4281,leaned over from the other side of the seat and asked in English:,65,11

4307,,0,11
4308,“Kansas City.”,14,11
4309,,0,11

4319,“Have a drink?”,15,11

4333,"“Yes,” he said. “I guess I like them.”",38,11

4335,Then after a little:,20,11

4337,“Where you go now?”,19,11
4338,,0,11
4339,“Up to Burguete to fish.”,25,11
4340,,0,11
4341,"“Well,” he said, “I hope you catch something.”",46,11
4342,,0,11
4343,He shook hands and turned around to the back seat again. The other,66,11
4344,Basques had been impressed. He sat back comfortably and smiled at me,68,11
4345,when I turned around to look at the country. But the effort of talking,70,11
4346,American seemed to have tired him. He did not say anything after that.,70,11
4347,,0,11
4348,The bus climbed steadily up the road. The country was barren and rocks,70,11
4349,stuck up through the clay. There was no grass beside the road. Looking,70,11
4350,back we could see the country spread out below. Far back the fields were,72,11
4351,squares of green and brown on the hillsides. Making the horizon were the,72,11
4352,brown mountains. They were strangely shaped. As we climbed higher the,69,11
4353,horizon kept changing. As the bus ground slowly up the road we could see,72,11
4354,other mountains coming up in the south. Then the road came over the,67,11
4355,"crest, flattened out, and went into a forest. It was a forest of cork",69,11
4356,"oaks, and the sun came through the trees in patches, and there were",67,11
4357,cattle grazing back in the trees. We went through the forest and the,68,11
4358,"road came out and turned along a rise of land, and out ahead of us was a",72,11
4359,"rolling green plain, with dark mountains beyond it. These were not like",71,11
4360,"the brown, heat-baked mountains we had left behind. These were wooded",69,11
4361,and there were clouds coming down from them. The green plain stretched,70,11
4362,off. It was cut by fences and the white of the road showed through the,70,11
4363,trunks of a double line of trees that crossed the plain toward the,66,11
4364,north. As we came to the edge of the rise we saw the red roofs and white,72,11
4365,"houses of Burguete ahead strung out on the plain, and away off on the",69,11
4366,shoulder of the first dark mountain was the gray metal-sheathed roof of,71,11
4367,the monastery of Roncesvalles.,30,11

4381,The bus levelled down onto the straight line of road that ran to,64,11
4382,Burguete. We passed a crossroads and crossed a bridge over a stream. The,72,11
4383,houses of Burguete were along both sides of the road. There were no,67,11
4384,"side-streets. We passed the church and the school-yard, and the bus",67,11
4385,stopped. We got down and the driver handed down our bags and the,64,11
4386,rod-case. A carabineer in his cocked hat and yellow leather cross-straps,72,11
4387,came up.,8,11
4388,,0,11
4389,“What’s in there?” he pointed to the rod-case.,46,11
4390,,0,11

4403,It was cold in the inn and the wind was starting to blow outside. The,69,11

4406,Nuestra Señora de Roncesvalles. The wind was blowing against the,64,11

4408,"sweaters, and came down-stairs into the dining-room. It had a stone",67,11

4492,cracked and split by the weather. It must have been left from the days,70,12
4493,before the motor-buses. A goat hopped up on one of the carts and then to,72,12

4497,"Bill was still sleeping, so I dressed, put on my shoes outside in the",69,12

4500,and the sun had not yet dried the dew that had come when the wind died,70,12
4501,down. I hunted around in the shed behind the inn and found a sort of,68,12
4502,"mattock, and went down toward the stream to try and dig some worms for",70,12
4503,bait. The stream was clear and shallow but it did not look trouty. On,69,12
4504,the grassy bank where it was damp I drove the mattock into the earth and,72,12
4505,loosened a chunk of sod. There were worms underneath. They slid out of,70,12
4506,sight as I lifted the sod and I dug carefully and got a good many.,66,12

4787,to where the water of a spring flowed out of an iron pipe. There was a,70,12
4788,"board over the spring and I lifted it and, knocking the corks firmly",68,12
4789,"into the bottles, lowered them down into the water. It was so cold my",69,12

4792,,0,12
4793,"I got my rod that was leaning against the tree, took the bait-can and",69,12

4796,squared timbers and watched the smooth apron of water before the river,70,12
4797,tumbled into the falls. In the white water at the foot of the dam it was,72,12
4798,"deep. As I baited up, a trout shot up out of the white water into the",69,12
4799,"falls and was carried down. Before I could finish baiting, another trout",72,12
4800,"jumped at the falls, making the same lovely arc and disappearing into",69,12
4801,the water that was thundering down. I put on a good-sized sinker and,68,12

4807,"double, out of the boiling water at the foot of the falls, and swung him",72,12
4808,"up and onto the dam. He was a good trout, and I banged his head against",71,12
4809,"the timber so that he quivered out straight, and then slipped him into",70,12
4810,my bag.,7,12
4811,,0,12
4812,"While I had him on, several trout had jumped at the falls. As soon as I",71,12
4813,baited up and dropped in again I hooked another and brought him in the,70,12
4814,same way. In a little while I had six. They were all about the same,67,12
4815,"size. I laid them out, side by side, all their heads pointing the same",70,12
4816,"way, and looked at them. They were beautifully colored and firm and hard",72,12
4817,"from the cold water. It was a hot day, so I slit them all and shucked",69,12

4819,"took the trout ashore, washed them in the cold, smoothly heavy water",68,12

5313,"up when the bus stopped, and a customs officer for the town made all the",72,13
5314,people getting down from the bus open their bundles on the sidewalk. We,71,13
5315,went into the hotel and on the stairs I met Montoya. He shook hands with,72,13
5316,"us, smiling in his embarrassed way.",35,13
5317,,0,13
5318,"“Your friends are here,” he said.",33,13

5320,“Mr. Campbell?”,15,13
5321,,0,13
5322,“Yes. Mr. Cohn and Mr. Campbell and Lady Ashley.”,49,13
5323,,0,13
5324,He smiled as though there were something I would hear about.,60,13
5325,,0,13
5326,“When did they get in?”,23,13
5327,,0,13
5328,“Yesterday. I’ve saved you the rooms you had.”,46,13

5340,"Montoya smiled. “To-night,” he said. “To-night at seven o’clock they",68,13
5341,"bring in the Villar bulls, and to-morrow come the Miuras. Do you all go",71,13

5343,,0,13
5344,"“Oh, yes. They’ve never seen a desencajonada.”",46,13
5345,,0,13

5347,,0,13
5348,“I’ll see you there.”,21,13
5349,,0,13
5350,He smiled again. He always smiled as though bull-fighting were a very,69,13
5351,special secret between the two of us; a rather shocking but really very,71,13
5352,deep secret that we knew about. He always smiled as though there were,69,13
5353,"something lewd about the secret to outsiders, but that it was something",71,13
5354,that we understood. It would not do to expose it to people who would not,72,13
5355,understand.,11,13
5356,,0,13
5357,"“Your friend, is he aficionado, too?” Montoya smiled at Bill.",61,13

5359,“Yes. He came all the way from New York to see the San Fermines.”,65,13
5360,,0,13
5361,“Yes?” Montoya politely disbelieved. “But he’s not aficionado like you.”,72,13
5362,,0,13
5363,He put his hand on my shoulder again embarrassedly.,51,13
5364,,0,13
5365,"“Yes,” I said. “He’s a real aficionado.”",40,13
5366,,0,13
5367,“But he’s not aficionado like you are.”,39,13
5368,,0,13
5369,Aficion means passion. An aficionado is one who is passionate about the,71,13
5370,bull-fights. All the good bull-fighters stayed at Montoya’s hotel; that,71,13
5371,"is, those with aficion stayed there. The commercial bull-fighters stayed",72,13
5372,"once, perhaps, and then did not come back. The good ones came each year.",72,13
5373,In Montoya’s room were their photographs. The photographs were dedicated,72,13
5374,to Juanito Montoya or to his sister. The photographs of bull-fighters,69,13
5375,Montoya had really believed in were framed. Photographs of bull-fighters,72,13
5376,who had been without aficion Montoya kept in a drawer of his desk. They,71,13
5377,often had the most flattering inscriptions. But they did not mean,65,13
5378,anything. One day Montoya took them all out and dropped them in the,67,13
5379,waste-basket. He did not want them around.,42,13
5380,,0,13
5381,We often talked about bulls and bull-fighters. I had stopped at the,67,13
5382,Montoya for several years. We never talked for very long at a time. It,70,13
5383,was simply the pleasure of discovering what we each felt. Men would come,72,13
5384,in from distant towns and before they left Pamplona stop and talk for a,71,13
5385,few minutes with Montoya about bulls. These men were aficionados. Those,71,13
5386,who were aficionados could always get rooms even when the hotel was,67,13
5387,full. Montoya introduced me to some of them. They were always very,66,13
5388,"polite at first, and it amused them very much that I should be an",65,13
5389,American. Somehow it was taken for granted that an American could not,69,13
5390,"have aficion. He might simulate it or confuse it with excitement, but he",72,13
5391,"could not really have it. When they saw that I had aficion, and there",69,13
5392,"was no password, no set questions that could bring it out, rather it was",72,13
5393,a sort of oral spiritual examination with the questions always a little,71,13
5394,"on the defensive and never apparent, there was this same embarrassed",68,13
5395,"putting the hand on the shoulder, or a “Buen hombre.” But nearly always",71,13
5396,there was the actual touching. It seemed as though they wanted to touch,71,13
5397,you to make it certain.,23,13
5398,,0,13
5399,Montoya could forgive anything of a bull-fighter who had aficion. He,68,13
5400,"could forgive attacks of nerves, panic, bad unexplainable actions, all",70,13
5401,sorts of lapses. For one who had aficion he could forgive anything. At,70,13
5402,once he forgave me all my friends. Without his ever saying anything they,72,13
5403,"were simply a little something shameful between us, like the spilling",69,13
5404,open of the horses in bull-fighting.,36,13

5605,"with the banners hung from the balcony, down past the market and down",69,13
5606,past the steep street that led to the bridge across the Arga. There were,72,13

5608,"the hill and across the bridge, the drivers, the horses, and the whips",70,13
5609,rising above the walking people in the street. Across the bridge we,67,13
5610,turned up a road to the corrals. We passed a wine-shop with a sign in,69,13

5615,The woman standing in the door of the wine-shop looked at us as we,66,13
5616,passed. She called to some one in the house and three girls came to the,71,13
5617,window and stared. They were staring at Brett.,46,13
5618,,0,13
5619,At the gate of the corrals two men took tickets from the people that,68,13
5620,"went in. We went in through the gate. There were trees inside and a low,",72,13
5621,"stone house. At the far end was the stone wall of the corrals, with",67,13
5622,apertures in the stone that were like loopholes running all along the,69,13
5623,"face of each corral. A ladder led up to the top of the wall, and people",71,13
5624,were climbing up the ladder and spreading down to stand on the walls,68,13
5625,"that separated the two corrals. As we came up the ladder, walking across",72,13
5626,"the grass under the trees, we passed the big, gray painted cages with",69,13
5627,the bulls in them. There was one bull in each travelling-box. They had,70,13
5628,"come by train from a bull-breeding ranch in Castile, and had been",65,13
5629,unloaded off flat-cars at the station and brought up here to be let out,71,13
5630,of their cages into the corrals. Each cage was stencilled with the name,71,13
5631,and the brand of the bull-breeder.,34,13
5632,,0,13
5633,We climbed up and found a place on the wall looking down into the,65,13
5634,"corral. The stone walls were whitewashed, and there was straw on the",68,13
5635,ground and wooden feed-boxes and water-troughs set against the wall.,68,13

5637,"“Look up there,” I said.",24,13

5639,Beyond the river rose the plateau of the town. All along the old walls,70,13
5640,and ramparts people were standing. The three lines of fortifications,68,13
5641,made three black lines of people. Above the walls there were heads in,69,13
5642,the windows of the houses. At the far end of the plateau boys had,65,13
5643,climbed into the trees.,23,13
5644,,0,13
5645,"“They must think something is going to happen,” Brett said.",59,13

5648,,0,13
5649,Mike and Bill were on the other wall across the pit of the corral. They,71,13

5651,against us when other people crowded them.,42,13
5652,,0,13
5653,“Why don’t they start?” Robert Cohn asked.,42,13
5654,,0,13
5655,A single mule was hitched to one of the cages and dragged it up against,71,13
5656,the gate in the corral wall. The men shoved and lifted it with crowbars,71,13
5657,into position against the gate. Men were standing on the wall ready to,70,13
5658,pull up the gate of the corral and then the gate of the cage. At the,68,13
5659,"other end of the corral a gate opened and two steers came in, swaying",69,13
5660,"their heads and trotting, their lean flanks swinging. They stood",64,13
5661,"together at the far end, their heads toward the gate where the bull",67,13
5662,would enter.,12,13

5666,The men on top of the wall leaned back and pulled up the door of the,68,13
5667,corral. Then they pulled up the door of the cage.,49,13
5668,,0,13
5669,I leaned way over the wall and tried to see into the cage. It was dark.,71,13
5670,Some one rapped on the cage with an iron bar. Inside something seemed to,72,13
5671,"explode. The bull, striking into the wood from side to side with his",68,13
5672,"horns, made a great noise. Then I saw a dark muzzle and the shadow of",69,13
5673,"horns, and then, with a clattering on the wood in the hollow box, the",69,13
5674,"bull charged and came out into the corral, skidding with his forefeet in",72,13
5675,"the straw as he stopped, his head up, the great hump of muscle on his",69,13
5676,"neck swollen tight, his body muscles quivering as he looked up at the",69,13
5677,"crowd on the stone walls. The two steers backed away against the wall,",70,13
5678,"their heads sunken, their eyes watching the bull.",49,13
5679,,0,13
5680,The bull saw them and charged. A man shouted from behind one of the,67,13
5681,"boxes and slapped his hat against the planks, and the bull, before he",69,13
5682,"reached the steer, turned, gathered himself and charged where the man",69,13
5683,"had been, trying to reach him behind the planks with a half-dozen quick,",72,13
5684,searching drives with the right horn.,37,13

5700,They had backed up another cage into the entrance. In the far corner a,70,13
5701,"man, from behind one of the plank shelters, attracted the bull, and",67,13
5702,while the bull was facing away the gate was pulled up and a second bull,71,13
5703,came out into the corral.,25,13
5704,,0,13
5705,He charged straight for the steers and two men ran out from behind the,70,13

5707,men shouted: “Hah! Hah! Toro!” and waved their arms; the two steers,67,13

5721,"steer which had been standing at the far end, his head swinging,",64,13
5722,"watching it all. The steer ran awkwardly and the bull caught him, hooked",72,13
5723,"him lightly in the flank, and then turned away and looked up at the",67,13
5724,"crowd on the walls, his crest of muscle rising. The steer came up to him",72,13
5725,and made as though to nose at him and the bull hooked perfunctorily. The,72,13

6032,and when I came in I put on the light over the head of the bed and,66,14
6033,started to read. I was reading a book by Turgenieff. Probably I read the,72,14
6034,same two pages over several times. It was one of the stories in “A,66,14
6035,"Sportsman’s Sketches.” I had read it before, but it seemed quite new.",69,14
6036,The country became very clear and the feeling of pressure in my head,68,14
6037,seemed to loosen. I was very drunk and I did not want to shut my eyes,69,14
6038,because the room would go round and round. If I kept on reading that,68,14
6039,feeling would pass.,19,14
6040,,0,14
6041,I heard Brett and Robert Cohn come up the stairs. Cohn said good night,70,14
6042,outside the door and went on up to his room. I heard Brett go into the,70,14
6043,room next door. Mike was already in bed. He had come in with me an hour,71,14
6044,"before. He woke as she came in, and they talked together. I heard them",70,14
6045,laugh. I turned off the light and tried to go to sleep. It was not,66,14
6046,necessary to read any more. I could shut my eyes without getting the,68,14
6047,wheeling sensation. But I could not sleep. There is no reason why,65,14
6048,because it is dark you should look at things differently from when it is,72,14
6049,light. The hell there isn’t!,28,14

6054,,0,14
6055,"Women made such swell friends. Awfully swell. In the first place, you",69,14
6056,had to be in love with a woman to have a basis of friendship. I had been,72,14
6057,having Brett for a friend. I had not been thinking about her side of it.,72,14
6058,I had been getting something for nothing. That only delayed the,63,14
6059,presentation of the bill. The bill always came. That was one of the,67,14
6060,swell things you could count on.,32,14
6061,,0,14
6062,I thought I had paid for everything. Not like the woman pays and pays,69,14
6063,and pays. No idea of retribution or punishment. Just exchange of values.,72,14
6064,You gave up something and got something else. Or you worked for,63,14
6065,something. You paid some way for everything that was any good. I paid my,72,14
6066,"way into enough things that I liked, so that I had a good time. Either",70,14
6067,"you paid by learning about them, or by experience, or by taking chances,",72,14
6068,or by money. Enjoying living was learning to get your money’s worth and,71,14
6069,knowing when you had it. You could get your money’s worth. The world was,72,14
6070,"a good place to buy in. It seemed like a fine philosophy. In five years,",72,14
6071,"I thought, it will seem just as silly as all the other fine philosophies",72,14
6072,I’ve had.,9,14
6073,,0,14
6074,"Perhaps that wasn’t true, though. Perhaps as you went along you did",67,14
6075,learn something. I did not care what it was all about. All I wanted to,70,14
6076,know was how to live in it. Maybe if you found out how to live in it you,72,14
6077,learned from that what it was all about.,40,14

6079,"I wished Mike would not behave so terribly to Cohn, though. Mike was a",70,14
6080,bad drunk. Brett was a good drunk. Bill was a good drunk. Cohn was never,72,14
6081,drunk. Mike was unpleasant after he passed a certain point. I liked to,70,14
6082,"see him hurt Cohn. I wished he would not do it, though, because",63,14
6083,afterward it made me disgusted at myself. That was morality; things that,72,14
6084,"made you disgusted afterward. No, that must be immorality. That was a",69,14
6085,large statement. What a lot of bilge I could think up at night. What,68,14
6086,"rot, I could hear Brett say it. What rot! When you were with English you",72,14
6087,got into the habit of using English expressions in your thinking. The,69,14
6088,"English spoken language—the upper classes, anyway—must have fewer",65,14
6089,words than the Eskimo. Of course I didn’t know anything about the,65,14
6090,Eskimo. Maybe the Eskimo was a fine language. Say the Cherokee. I didn’t,72,14
6091,"know anything about the Cherokee, either. The English talked with",65,14
6092,"inflected phrases. One phrase to mean everything. I liked them, though.",71,14

6096,I turned on the light again and read. I read the Turgenieff. I knew that,72,14
6097,"now, reading it in the oversensitized state of my mind after much too",69,14
6098,"much brandy, I would remember it somewhere, and afterward it would seem",71,14
6099,as though it had really happened to me. I would always have it. That was,72,14

6106,The town was getting ready for the fiesta. Workmen put up the gate-posts,72,14
6107,that were to shut off the side streets when the bulls were released from,72,14
6108,the corrals and came running through the streets in the morning on their,72,14
6109,"way to the ring. The workmen dug holes and fitted in the timbers, each",70,14
6110,timber numbered for its regular place. Out on the plateau beyond the,68,14
6111,"town employees of the bull-ring exercised picador horses, galloping them",72,14
6112,"stiff-legged on the hard, sun-baked fields behind the bull-ring. The big",72,14
6113,"gate of the bull-ring was open, and inside the amphitheatre was being",69,14
6114,"swept. The ring was rolled and sprinkled, and carpenters replaced",65,14
6115,weakened or cracked planks in the barrera. Standing at the edge of the,70,14
6116,smooth rolled sand you could look up in the empty stands and see old,68,14

6118,,0,14
6119,"Outside, the fence that led from the last street of the town to the",67,14
6120,entrance of the bull-ring was already in place and made a long pen; the,71,14
6121,crowd would come running down with the bulls behind them on the morning,71,14
6122,"of the day of the first bull-fight. Out across the plain, where the",67,14
6123,"horse and cattle fair would be, some gypsies had camped under the trees.",72,14
6124,The wine and aguardiente sellers were putting up their booths. One booth,72,14
6125,advertised =ANIS DEL TORO=. The cloth sign hung against the,59,14
6126,planks in the hot sun. In the big square that was the centre of the town,72,14
6127,there was no change yet. We sat in the white wicker chairs on the,65,14
6128,terrasse of the café and watched the motor-buses come in and unload,67,14
6129,"peasants from the country coming in to the market, and we watched the",69,14
6130,buses fill up and start out with peasants sitting with their saddle-bags,72,14
6131,full of the things they had bought in the town. The tall gray,61,14
6132,motor-buses were the only life of the square except for the pigeons and,71,14

6141,During the morning I usually sat in the café and read the Madrid papers,71,14
6142,and then walked in the town or out into the country. Sometimes Bill went,72,14
6143,along. Sometimes he wrote in his room. Robert Cohn spent the mornings,69,14
6144,studying Spanish or trying to get a shave at the barber-shop. Brett and,71,14
6145,Mike never got up until noon. We all had a vermouth at the café. It was,71,14
6146,"a quiet life and no one was drunk. I went to church a couple of times,",70,14
6147,"once with Brett. She said she wanted to hear me go to confession, but I",71,14
6148,told her that not only was it impossible but it was not as interesting,70,14
6149,"as it sounded, and, besides, it would be in a language she did not know.",72,14
6150,"We met Cohn as we came out of church, and although it was obvious he had",72,14
6151,"followed us, yet he was very pleasant and nice, and we all three went",69,14

6169,"At noon of Sunday, the 6th of July, the fiesta exploded. There is no",68,15
6170,other way to describe it. People had been coming in all day from the,68,15
6171,"country, but they were assimilated in the town and you did not notice",69,15
6172,them. The square was as quiet in the hot sun as on any other day. The,69,15
6173,"peasants were in the outlying wine-shops. There they were drinking,",67,15
6174,getting ready for the fiesta. They had come in so recently from the,67,15
6175,plains and the hills that it was necessary that they make their shifting,72,15
6176,in values gradually. They could not start in paying café prices. They,69,15
6177,got their money’s worth in the wine-shops. Money still had a definite,69,15
6178,value in hours worked and bushels of grain sold. Late in the fiesta it,70,15

6181,Now on the day of the starting of the fiesta of San Fermin they had been,72,15

6183,Going down the streets in the morning on the way to mass in the,63,15
6184,"cathedral, I heard them singing through the open doors of the shops.",68,15

6186,San Fermin is also a religious festival.,40,15
6187,,0,15
6188,I walked down the hill from the cathedral and up the street to the café,71,15
6189,on the square. It was a little before noon. Robert Cohn and Bill were,69,15
6190,sitting at one of the tables. The marble-topped tables and the white,68,15
6191,wicker chairs were gone. They were replaced by cast-iron tables and,67,15
6192,severe folding chairs. The café was like a battleship stripped for,66,15
6193,action. To-day the waiters did not leave you alone all morning to read,70,15
6194,without asking if you wanted to order something. A waiter came up as,68,15
6195,soon as I sat down.,19,15

6203,Before the waiter brought the sherry the rocket that announced the,66,15

6205,"smoke high up above the Theatre Gayarre, across on the other side of the",72,15
6206,"plaza. The ball of smoke hung in the sky like a shrapnel burst, and as I",72,15
6207,"watched, another rocket came up to it, trickling smoke in the bright",68,15
6208,sunlight. I saw the bright flash as it burst and another little cloud of,72,15
6209,smoke appeared. By the time the second rocket had burst there were so,69,15
6210,"many people in the arcade, that had been empty a minute before, that the",72,15
6211,"waiter, holding the bottle high up over his head, could hardly get",66,15
6212,through the crowd to our table. People were coming into the square from,71,15
6213,"all sides, and down the street we heard the pipes and the fifes and the",71,15
6214,"drums coming. They were playing the _riau-riau_ music, the pipes shrill",71,15
6215,"and the drums pounding, and behind them came the men and boys dancing.",70,15
6216,"When the fifers stopped they all crouched down in the street, and when",70,15
6217,"the reed-pipes and the fifes shrilled, and the flat, dry, hollow drums",70,15

6252,The fiesta was really started. It kept up day and night for seven days.,71,15
6253,"The dancing kept up, the drinking kept up, the noise went on. The things",72,15
6254,that happened could only have happened during a fiesta. Everything,66,15
6255,became quite unreal finally and it seemed as though nothing could have,70,15
6256,any consequences. It seemed out of place to think of consequences during,72,15
6257,"the fiesta. All during the fiesta you had the feeling, even when it was",71,15
6258,"quiet, that you had to shout any remark to make it heard. It was the",68,15
6259,same feeling about any action. It was a fiesta and it went on for seven,71,15
6260,days.,5,15
6261,,0,15
6262,That afternoon was the big religious procession. San Fermin was,63,15
6263,translated from one church to another. In the procession were all the,69,15
6264,"dignitaries, civil and religious. We could not see them because the",67,15
6265,crowd was too great. Ahead of the formal procession and behind it danced,72,15
6266,the _riau-riau_ dancers. There was one mass of yellow shirts dancing up,71,15
6267,and down in the crowd. All we could see of the procession through the,69,15
6268,closely pressed people that crowded all the side streets and curbs were,71,15
6269,"the great giants, cigar-store Indians, thirty feet high, Moors, a King",70,15
6270,"and Queen, whirling and waltzing solemnly to the _riau-riau_.",61,15
6271,,0,15
6272,They were all standing outside the chapel where San Fermin and the,66,15
6273,"dignitaries had passed in, leaving a guard of soldiers, the giants, with",72,15
6274,"the men who danced in them standing beside their resting frames, and the",72,15
6275,dwarfs moving with their whacking bladders through the crowd. We started,72,15
6276,inside and there was a smell of incense and people filing back into the,71,15
6277,"church, but Brett was stopped just inside the door because she had no",69,15
6278,"hat, so we went out again and along the street that ran back from the",69,15
6279,chapel into town. The street was lined on both sides with people keeping,72,15
6280,their place at the curb for the return of the procession. Some dancers,70,15
6281,formed a circle around Brett and started to dance. They wore big wreaths,72,15
6282,of white garlics around their necks. They took Bill and me by the arms,70,15
6283,"and put us in the circle. Bill started to dance, too. They were all",67,15
6284,chanting. Brett wanted to dance but they did not want her to. They,66,15
6285,wanted her as an image to dance around. When the song ended with the,68,15
6286,sharp _riau-riau!_ they rushed us into a wine-shop.,51,15
6287,,0,15
6288,We stood at the counter. They had Brett seated on a wine-cask. It was,69,15
6289,"dark in the wine-shop and full of men singing, hard-voiced singing. Back",72,15
6290,of the counter they drew the wine from casks. I put down money for the,70,15
6291,"wine, but one of the men picked it up and put it back in my pocket.",67,15
6292,,0,15
6293,"“I want a leather wine-bottle,” Bill said.",42,15
6294,,0,15
6295,"“There’s a place down the street,” I said. “I’ll go get a couple.”",66,15
6296,,0,15
6297,The dancers did not want me to go out. Three of them were sitting on the,72,15
6298,"high wine-cask beside Brett, teaching her to drink out of the",61,15
6299,wine-skins. They had hung a wreath of garlics around her neck. Some one,71,15
6300,insisted on giving her a glass. Somebody was teaching Bill a song.,66,15
6301,Singing it into his ear. Beating time on Bill’s back.,53,15
6302,,0,15
6303,I explained to them that I would be back. Outside in the street I went,70,15
6304,down the street looking for the shop that made leather wine-bottles. The,72,15
6305,"crowd was packed on the sidewalks and many of the shops were shuttered,",71,15
6306,"and I could not find it. I walked as far as the church, looking on both",71,15
6307,sides of the street. Then I asked a man and he took me by the arm and,69,15
6308,led me to it. The shutters were up but the door was open.,57,15
6309,,0,15
6310,Inside it smelled of fresh tanned leather and hot tar. A man was,64,15
6311,stencilling completed wine-skins. They hung from the roof in bunches. He,72,15
6312,"took one down, blew it up, screwed the nozzle tight, and then jumped on",71,15
6313,it,2,15
6314,,0,15
6315,“See! It doesn’t leak.”,23,15
6316,,0,15
6317,"“I want another one, too. A big one.”",37,15
6318,,0,15
6319,"He took down a big one that would hold a gallon or more, from the roof.",71,15
6320,"He blew it up, his cheeks puffing ahead of the wine-skin, and stood on",70,15
6321,the bota holding on to a chair.,31,15
6322,,0,15
6323,“What are you going to do? Sell them in Bayonne?”,49,15
6324,,0,15
6325,“No. Drink out of them.”,24,15
6326,,0,15
6327,He slapped me on the back.,26,15
6328,,0,15
6329,“Good man. Eight pesetas for the two. The lowest price.”,56,15
6330,,0,15
6331,The man who was stencilling the new ones and tossing them into a pile,69,15
6332,stopped.,8,15
6333,,0,15
6334,"“It’s true,” he said. “Eight pesetas is cheap.”",47,15
6335,,0,15
6336,I paid and went out and along the street back to the wine-shop. It was,70,15
6337,"darker than ever inside and very crowded. I did not see Brett and Bill,",71,15
6338,and some one said they were in the back room. At the counter the girl,69,15
6339,filled the two wine-skins for me. One held two litres. The other held,69,15
6340,five litres. Filling them both cost three pesetas sixty centimos. Some,70,15
6341,"one at the counter, that I had never seen before, tried to pay for the",70,15
6342,"wine, but I finally paid for it myself. The man who had wanted to pay",69,15
6343,"then bought me a drink. He would not let me buy one in return, but said",71,15
6344,he would take a rinse of the mouth from the new wine-bag. He tipped the,71,15
6345,big five-litre bag up and squeezed it so the wine hissed against the,68,15
6346,back of his throat.,19,15
6347,,0,15
6348,"“All right,” he said, and handed back the bag.",46,15
6349,,0,15
6350,In the back room Brett and Bill were sitting on barrels surrounded by,69,15
6351,"the dancers. Everybody had his arms on everybody else’s shoulders, and",70,15
6352,they were all singing. Mike was sitting at a table with several men in,70,15
6353,"their shirt-sleeves, eating from a bowl of tuna fish, chopped onions and",72,15
6354,vinegar. They were all drinking wine and mopping up the oil and vinegar,71,15

6423,In a back room Robert Cohn was sleeping quietly on some wine-casks. It,70,15
6424,was almost too dark to see his face. They had covered him with a coat,69,15
6425,and another coat was folded under his head. Around his neck and on his,70,15

6471,"square solid with people, those in the centre all dancing.",58,15
6472,,0,15
6473,It was a big meal at the hotel. It was the first meal of the prices,67,15
6474,"being doubled for the fiesta, and there were several new courses. After",71,15
6475,the dinner we were out in the town. I remember resolving that I would,69,15
6476,stay up all night to watch the bulls go through the streets at six,66,15
6477,"o’clock in the morning, and being so sleepy that I went to bed around",69,15
6478,four o’clock. The others stayed up.,35,15
6479,,0,15
6480,"My own room was locked and I could not find the key, so I went up-stairs",72,15
6481,and slept on one of the beds in Cohn’s room. The fiesta was going on,68,15
6482,"outside in the night, but I was too sleepy for it to keep me awake. When",72,15
6483,I woke it was the sound of the rocket exploding that announced the,66,15
6484,release of the bulls from the corrals at the edge of town. They would,69,15
6485,race through the streets and out to the bull-ring. I had been sleeping,70,15
6486,heavily and I woke feeling I was too late. I put on a coat of Cohn’s and,72,15
6487,went out on the balcony. Down below the narrow street was empty. All the,72,15
6488,balconies were crowded with people. Suddenly a crowd came down the,66,15
6489,"street. They were all running, packed close together. They passed along",71,15
6490,and up the street toward the bull-ring and behind them came more men,68,15
6491,"running faster, and then some stragglers who were really running. Behind",72,15
6492,"them was a little bare space, and then the bulls galloping, tossing",67,15
6493,their heads up and down. It all went out of sight around the corner. One,72,15
6494,"man fell, rolled to the gutter, and lay quiet. But the bulls went right",71,15
6495,on and did not notice him. They were all running together.,58,15
6496,,0,15
6497,After they went out of sight a great roar came from the bull-ring. It,69,15
6498,kept on. Then finally the pop of the rocket that meant the bulls had,68,15
6499,gotten through the people in the ring and into the corrals. I went back,71,15
6500,in the room and got into bed. I had been standing on the stone balcony,70,15
6501,in bare feet. I knew our crowd must have all been out at the bull-ring.,71,15
6502,"Back in bed, I went to sleep.",29,15
6503,,0,15
6504,Cohn woke me when he came in. He started to undress and went over and,69,15

6547,No one was up before noon. We ate at tables set out under the arcade.,69,15

6550,"bull-fight came it got fuller, and the tables were crowded closer. There",72,15
6551,"was a close, crowded hum that came every day before the bull-fight. The",71,15

6614,Montoya knocked on the door and opened it. It was a gloomy room with a,70,15
6615,little light coming in from the window on the narrow street. There were,71,15
6616,two beds separated by a monastic partition. The electric light was on.,70,15
6617,The boy stood very straight and unsmiling in his bull-fighting clothes.,71,15
6618,His jacket hung over the back of a chair. They were just finishing,66,15
6619,winding his sash. His black hair shone under the electric light. He wore,72,15
6620,a white linen shirt and the sword-handler finished his sash and stood up,72,15
6621,"and stepped back. Pedro Romero nodded, seeming very far away and",64,15
6622,dignified when we shook hands. Montoya said something about what great,70,15
6623,"aficionados we were, and that we wanted to wish him luck. Romero",64,15
6624,listened very seriously. Then he turned to me. He was the best-looking,70,15
6625,boy I have ever seen.,21,15

6633,One of three men who had been sitting on the beds came up and asked us,70,15
6634,if we spoke French. “Would you like me to interpret for you? Is there,69,15
6635,anything you would like to ask Pedro Romero?”,45,15
6636,,0,15
6637,We thanked him. What was there that you would like to ask? The boy was,70,15
6638,"nineteen years old, alone except for his sword-handler, and the three",69,15
6639,"hangers-on, and the bull-fight was to commence in twenty minutes. We",68,15
6640,"wished him “Mucha suerte,” shook hands, and went out. He was standing,",70,15
6641,"straight and handsome and altogether by himself, alone in the room with",71,15
6642,the hangers-on as we shut the door.,35,15
6643,,0,15
6644,"“He’s a fine boy, don’t you think so?” Montoya asked.",53,15

6654,We found the big leather wine-bottle leaning against the wall in my,67,15

6656,down-stairs.,12,15
6657,,0,15
6658,It was a good bull-fight. Bill and I were very excited about Pedro,66,15
6659,Romero. Montoya was sitting about ten places away. After Romero had,67,15
6660,killed his first bull Montoya caught my eye and nodded his head. This,69,15
6661,was a real one. There had not been a real one for a long time. Of the,69,15
6662,"other two matadors, one was very fair and the other was passable. But",69,15
6663,"there was no comparison with Romero, although neither of his bulls was",70,15
6664,much.,5,15
6665,,0,15
6666,Several times during the bull-fight I looked up at Mike and Brett and,69,15
6667,"Cohn, with the glasses. They seemed to be all right. Brett did not look",71,15
6668,upset. All three were leaning forward on the concrete railing in front,70,15
6669,of them.,8,15

6677,"Outside the ring, after the bull-fight was over, you could not move in",70,15
6678,the crowd. We could not make our way through but had to be moved with,69,15
6679,"the whole thing, slowly, as a glacier, back to town. We had that",64,15
6680,"disturbed emotional feeling that always comes after a bull-fight, and",69,15
6681,the feeling of elation that comes after a good bull-fight. The fiesta,69,15
6682,"was going on. The drums pounded and the pipe music was shrill, and",66,15
6683,everywhere the flow of the crowd was broken by patches of dancers. The,70,15
6684,"dancers were in a crowd, so you did not see the intricate play of the",69,15
6685,"feet. All you saw was the heads and shoulders going up and down, up and",71,15
6686,"down. Finally, we got out of the crowd and made for the café. The waiter",72,15
6687,"saved chairs for the others, and we each ordered an absinthe and watched",72,15
6688,the crowd in the square and the dancers.,40,15
6689,,0,15

6698,,0,15
6699,In front of us on a clear part of the street a company of boys were,67,15
6700,dancing. The steps were very intricate and their faces were intent and,70,15
6701,concentrated. They all looked down while they danced. Their rope-soled,70,15
6702,shoes tapped and spatted on the pavement. The toes touched. The heels,69,15
6703,touched. The balls of the feet touched. Then the music broke wildly and,71,15
6704,the step was finished and they were all dancing on up the street.,65,15

6819,The bull-fight on the second day was much better than on the first.,67,15
6820,"Brett sat between Mike and me at the barrera, and Bill and Cohn went up",71,15
6821,above. Romero was the whole show. I do not think Brett saw any other,68,15
6822,"bull-fighter. No one else did either, except the hard-shelled",61,15
6823,"technicians. It was all Romero. There were two other matadors, but they",71,15
6824,did not count. I sat beside Brett and explained to Brett what it was all,72,15
6825,"about. I told her about watching the bull, not the horse, when the bulls",72,15
6826,"charged the picadors, and got her to watching the picador place the",67,15
6827,"point of his pic so that she saw what it was all about, so that it",66,15
6828,"became more something that was going on with a definite end, and less of",72,15
6829,a spectacle with unexplained horrors. I had her watch how Romero took,69,15
6830,"the bull away from a fallen horse with his cape, and how he held him",68,15
6831,"with the cape and turned him, smoothly and suavely, never wasting the",69,15
6832,bull. She saw how Romero avoided every brusque movement and saved his,69,15
6833,"bulls for the last when he wanted them, not winded and discomposed but",70,15
6834,"smoothly worn down. She saw how close Romero always worked to the bull,",71,15
6835,and I pointed out to her the tricks the other bull-fighters used to make,72,15
6836,it look as though they were working closely. She saw why she liked,66,15
6837,Romero’s cape-work and why she did not like the others.,55,15
6838,,0,15
6839,"Romero never made any contortions, always it was straight and pure and",70,15
6840,"natural in line. The others twisted themselves like corkscrews, their",69,15
6841,"elbows raised, and leaned against the flanks of the bull after his horns",72,15
6842,"had passed, to give a faked look of danger. Afterward, all that was",67,15
6843,faked turned bad and gave an unpleasant feeling. Romero’s bull-fighting,71,15
6844,"gave real emotion, because he kept the absolute purity of line in his",69,15
6845,movements and always quietly and calmly let the horns pass him close,68,15
6846,each time. He did not have to emphasize their closeness. Brett saw how,70,15
6847,something that was beautiful done close to the bull was ridiculous if it,72,15
6848,were done a little way off. I told her how since the death of Joselito,70,15
6849,all the bull-fighters had been developing a technic that simulated this,71,15
6850,"appearance of danger in order to give a fake emotional feeling, while",69,15
6851,"the bull-fighter was really safe. Romero had the old thing, the holding",71,15
6852,"of his purity of line through the maximum of exposure, while he",63,15
6853,"dominated the bull by making him realize he was unattainable, while he",70,15
6854,prepared him for the killing.,29,15

7053,"to come over and meet a friend. His table was beside ours, almost",65,16
7054,"touching. I met the friend, a Madrid bull-fight critic, a little man",68,16
7055,"with a drawn face. I told Romero how much I liked his work, and he was",70,16
7056,very pleased. We talked Spanish and the critic knew a little French. I,70,16

7065,"_Corrida de toros_, the exact translation. Bull-fight he was suspicious",71,16
7066,of. I explained that bull-fight in Spanish was the _lidia_ of a _toro_.,71,16
7067,The Spanish word _corrida_ means in English the running of bulls—the,68,16
7068,French translation is _Course de taureaux_. The critic put that in.,67,16
7069,There is no Spanish word for bull-fight.,40,16
7070,,0,16
7071,Pedro Romero said he had learned a little English in Gibraltar. He was,70,16
7072,born in Ronda. That is not far above Gibraltar. He started bull-fighting,72,16
7073,in Malaga in the bull-fighting school there. He had only been at it,67,16
7074,three years. The bull-fight critic joked him about the number of,64,16
7075,"_Malagueño_ expressions he used. He was nineteen years old, he said. His",72,16
7076,"older brother was with him as a banderillero, but he did not live in",68,16
7077,this hotel. He lived in a smaller hotel with the other people who worked,72,16
7078,for Romero. He asked me how many times I had seen him in the ring. I,68,16
7079,"told him only three. It was really only two, but I did not want to",66,16
7080,explain after I had made the mistake.,37,16

7093,,0,16
7094,He was not at all embarrassed. He talked of his work as something,65,16

8142,the outside balconies and the top of the bull-ring were solid with,66,17

8145,fence. I was pushed close against the planks of the fence. Between the,70,17
8146,two fences of the runway the police were clearing the crowd along. They,71,17
8147,walked or trotted on into the bull-ring. Then people commenced to come,70,17
8148,running. A drunk slipped and fell. Two policemen grabbed him and rushed,71,17
8149,him over to the fence. The crowd were running fast now. There was a,67,17
8150,"great shout from the crowd, and putting my head through between the",67,17
8151,boards I saw the bulls just coming out of the street into the long,66,17
8152,running pen. They were going fast and gaining on the crowd. Just then,69,17
8153,another drunk started out from the fence with a blouse in his hands. He,71,17

8155,"collared him, one hit him with a club, and they dragged him against the",71,17

8157,and the bulls went by. There were so many people running ahead of the,69,17
8158,bulls that the mass thickened and slowed up going through the gate into,71,17
8159,"the ring, and as the bulls passed, galloping together, heavy,",61,17
8160,"muddy-sided, horns swinging, one shot ahead, caught a man in the running",72,17
8161,crowd in the back and lifted him in the air. Both the man’s arms were by,72,17
8162,"his sides, his head went back as the horn went in, and the bull lifted",70,17
8163,"him and then dropped him. The bull picked another man running in front,",71,17
8164,"but the man disappeared into the crowd, and the crowd was through the",69,17
8165,gate and into the ring with the bulls behind them. The red door of the,70,17
8166,"ring went shut, the crowd on the outside balconies of the bull-ring were",72,17

8170,"climbed over the fence, and I could not see the man because the crowd",69,17
8171,was so thick around him. From inside the ring came the shouts. Each,67,17
8172,shout meant a charge by some bull into the crowd. You could tell by the,71,17
8173,degree of intensity in the shout how bad a thing it was that was,64,17
8174,happening. Then the rocket went up that meant the steers had gotten the,71,17

8532,At noon we were all at the café. It was crowded. We were eating shrimps,71,18
8533,and drinking beer. The town was crowded. Every street was full. Big,67,18
8534,motor-cars from Biarritz and San Sebastian kept driving up and parking,70,18
8535,around the square. They brought people for the bull-fight. Sight-seeing,71,18
8536,"cars came up, too. There was one with twenty-five Englishwomen in it.",69,18
8537,"They sat in the big, white car and looked through their glasses at the",70,18
8538,fiesta. The dancers were all quite drunk. It was the last day of the,68,18
8539,fiesta.,7,18
8540,,0,18
8541,"The fiesta was solid and unbroken, but the motor-cars and tourist-cars",70,18
8542,"made little islands of onlookers. When the cars emptied, the onlookers",70,18
8543,were absorbed into the crowd. You did not see them again except as sport,72,18
8544,"clothes, odd-looking at a table among the closely packed peasants in",68,18
8545,black smocks. The fiesta absorbed even the Biarritz English so that you,71,18
8546,did not see them unless you passed close to a table. All the time there,71,18
8547,was music in the street. The drums kept on pounding and the pipes were,70,18
8548,"going. Inside the cafés men with their hands gripping the table, or on",70,18
8549,"each other’s shoulders, were singing the hard-voiced singing.",61,18

8551,"“Here comes Brett,” Bill said.",30,18

8553,"I looked and saw her coming through the crowd in the square, walking,",69,18

8572,"“Very good,” I said. I was nervous about Mike. I did not think he had",69,18

8644,We walked along past the theatre and out of the square and along through,72,18
8645,"the barracks of the fair, moving with the crowd between the lines of",68,18

8671,,0,18
8672,We went in through the heavy leather door that moved very lightly. It,69,18
8673,was dark inside. Many people were praying. You saw them as your eyes,68,18
8674,adjusted themselves to the half-light. We knelt at one of the long,66,18
8675,"wooden benches. After a little I felt Brett stiffen beside me, and saw",70,18
8676,she was looking straight ahead.,31,18

8718,"It was the first time I had seen her in the old happy, careless way",67,18

8810,We ate at a restaurant in a side street off the square. They were all,69,18
8811,men eating in the restaurant. It was full of smoke and drinking and,67,18
8812,singing. The food was good and so was the wine. We did not talk much.,69,18
8813,Afterward we went to the café and watched the fiesta come to the,64,18
8814,boiling-point. Brett came over soon after lunch. She said she had looked,72,18
8815,in the room and that Mike was asleep.,37,18
8816,,0,18
8817,When the fiesta boiled over and toward the bull-ring we went with the,69,18
8818,crowd. Brett sat at the ringside between Bill and me. Directly below us,71,18
8819,"was the callejon, the passageway between the stands and the red fence of",72,18
8820,"the barrera. Behind us the concrete stands filled solidly. Out in front,",72,18
8821,"beyond the red fence, the sand of the ring was smooth-rolled and yellow.",72,18
8822,"It looked a little heavy from the rain, but it was dry in the sun and",69,18
8823,firm and smooth. The sword-handlers and bull-ring servants came down the,72,18
8824,callejon carrying on their shoulders the wicker baskets of fighting,67,18
8825,capes and muletas. They were bloodstained and compactly folded and,66,18
8826,packed in the baskets. The sword-handlers opened the heavy leather,66,18
8827,sword-cases so the red wrapped hilts of the sheaf of swords showed as,69,18
8828,the leather case leaned against the fence. They unfolded the,60,18
8829,dark-stained red flannel of the muletas and fixed batons in them to,67,18
8830,spread the stuff and give the matador something to hold. Brett watched,70,18
8831,it all. She was absorbed in the professional details.,53,18
8832,,0,18
8833,"“He’s his name stencilled on all the capes and muletas,” she said. “Why",71,18

8842,"“The blood must stiffen them,” Bill said.",41,18
8843,,0,18
8844,"“Funny,” Brett said. “How one doesn’t mind the blood.”",54,18
8845,,0,18
8846,Below in the narrow passage of the callejon the sword-handlers arranged,71,18
8847,"everything. All the seats were full. Above, all the boxes were full.",68,18
8848,There was not an empty seat except in the President’s box. When he came,71,18
8849,"in the fight would start. Across the smooth sand, in the high doorway",69,18
8850,"that led into the corrals, the bull-fighters were standing, their arms",70,18
8851,"furled in their capes, talking, waiting for the signal to march in",66,18
8852,across the arena. Brett was watching them with the glasses.,59,18
8853,,0,18
8854,"“Here, would you like to look?”",31,18
8855,,0,18
8856,I looked through the glasses and saw the three matadors. Romero was in,70,18
8857,"the centre, Belmonte on his left, Marcial on his right. Back of them",68,18
8858,"were their people, and behind the banderilleros, back in the passageway",71,18
8859,"and in the open space of the corral, I saw the picadors. Romero was",67,18
8860,wearing a black suit. His tricornered hat was low down over his eyes. I,71,18
8861,"could not see his face clearly under the hat, but it looked badly",65,18
8862,marked. He was looking straight ahead. Marcial was smoking a cigarette,70,18
8863,"guardedly, holding it in his hand. Belmonte looked ahead, his face wan",70,18
8864,"and yellow, his long wolf jaw out. He was looking at nothing. Neither he",72,18
8865,nor Romero seemed to have anything in common with the others. They were,71,18
8866,all alone. The President came in; there was handclapping above us in the,72,18
8867,"grand stand, and I handed the glasses to Brett. There was applause. The",71,18
8868,music started. Brett looked through the glasses.,48,18
8869,,0,18
8870,"“Here, take them,” she said.",28,18
8871,,0,18
8872,Through the glasses I saw Belmonte speak to Romero. Marcial straightened,72,18
8873,"up and dropped his cigarette, and, looking straight ahead, their heads",70,18
8874,"back, their free arms swinging, the three matadors walked out. Behind",69,18
8875,"them came all the procession, opening out, all striding in step, all the",72,18
8876,"capes furled, everybody with free arms swinging, and behind rode the",68,18
8877,"picadors, their pics rising like lances. Behind all came the two trains",71,18
8878,"of mules and the bull-ring servants. The matadors bowed, holding their",70,18
8879,"hats on, before the President’s box, and then came over to the barrera",70,18
8880,below us. Pedro Romero took off his heavy gold-brocaded cape and handed,71,18
8881,it over the fence to his sword-handler. He said something to the,64,18
8882,"sword-handler. Close below us we saw Romero’s lips were puffed, both",68,18
8883,eyes were discolored. His face was discolored and swollen. The,62,18
8884,"sword-handler took the cape, looked up at Brett, and came over to us and",72,18
8885,handed up the cape.,19,18
8886,,0,18
8887,"“Spread it out in front of you,” I said.",40,18
8888,,0,18
8889,Brett leaned forward. The cape was heavy and smoothly stiff with gold.,70,18
8890,"The sword-handler looked back, shook his head, and said something. A man",72,18
8891,beside me leaned over toward Brett.,35,18
8892,,0,18
8893,"“He doesn’t want you to spread it,” he said. “You should fold it and",68,18
8894,keep it in your lap.”,21,18
8895,,0,18
8896,Brett folded the heavy cape.,28,18
8897,,0,18
8898,Romero did not look up at us. He was speaking to Belmonte. Belmonte had,71,18
8899,sent his formal cape over to some friends. He looked across at them and,71,18
8900,"smiled, his wolf smile that was only with the mouth. Romero leaned over",71,18
8901,the barrera and asked for the water-jug. The sword-handler brought it,69,18

8913,The first bull was Belmonte’s. Belmonte was very good. But because he,69,18
8914,got thirty thousand pesetas and people had stayed in line all night to,70,18
8915,"buy tickets to see him, the crowd demanded that he should be more than",70,18
8916,very good. Belmonte’s great attraction is working close to the bull. In,71,18
8917,bull-fighting they speak of the terrain of the bull and the terrain of,70,18
8918,the bull-fighter. As long as a bull-fighter stays in his own terrain he,71,18
8919,is comparatively safe. Each time he enters into the terrain of the bull,71,18
8920,"he is in great danger. Belmonte, in his best days, worked always in the",71,18
8921,terrain of the bull. This way he gave the sensation of coming tragedy.,70,18
8922,"People went to the corrida to see Belmonte, to be given tragic",62,18
8923,"sensations, and perhaps to see the death of Belmonte. Fifteen years ago",71,18
8924,"they said if you wanted to see Belmonte you should go quickly, while he",71,18
8925,was still alive. Since then he has killed more than a thousand bulls.,69,18
8926,"When he retired the legend grew up about how his bull-fighting had been,",72,18
8927,and when he came out of retirement the public were disappointed because,71,18
8928,no real man could work as close to the bulls as Belmonte was supposed to,72,18
8929,"have done, not, of course, even Belmonte.",41,18
8930,,0,18
8931,Also Belmonte imposed conditions and insisted that his bulls should not,71,18
8932,"be too large, nor too dangerously armed with horns, and so the element",70,18
8933,"that was necessary to give the sensation of tragedy was not there, and",70,18
8934,"the public, who wanted three times as much from Belmonte, who was sick",70,18
8935,"with a fistula, as Belmonte had ever been able to give, felt defrauded",70,18
8936,"and cheated, and Belmonte’s jaw came further out in contempt, and his",69,18
8937,"face turned yellower, and he moved with greater difficulty as his pain",70,18
8938,"increased, and finally the crowd were actively against him, and he was",70,18
8939,utterly contemptuous and indifferent. He had meant to have a great,66,18
8940,"afternoon, and instead it was an afternoon of sneers, shouted insults,",70,18
8941,"and finally a volley of cushions and pieces of bread and vegetables,",68,18
8942,thrown down at him in the plaza where he had had his greatest triumphs.,71,18
8943,His jaw only went further out. Sometimes he turned to smile that,64,18
8944,"toothed, long-jawed, lipless smile when he was called something",63,18
8945,"particularly insulting, and always the pain that any movement produced",70,18
8946,"grew stronger and stronger, until finally his yellow face was parchment",71,18
8947,"color, and after his second bull was dead and the throwing of bread and",71,18
8948,"cushions was over, after he had saluted the President with the same",67,18
8949,"wolf-jawed smile and contemptuous eyes, and handed his sword over the",69,18
8950,"barrera to be wiped, and put back in its case, he passed through into",69,18
8951,"the callejon and leaned on the barrera below us, his head on his arms,",70,18
8952,"not seeing, not hearing anything, only going through his pain. When he",70,18
8953,"looked up, finally, he asked for a drink of water. He swallowed a",65,18
8954,"little, rinsed his mouth, spat the water, took his cape, and went back",70,18
8955,into the ring.,14,18
8956,,0,18
8957,Because they were against Belmonte the public were for Romero. From the,71,18
8958,moment he left the barrera and went toward the bull they applauded him.,71,18
8959,"Belmonte watched Romero, too, watched him always without seeming to. He",71,18
8960,paid no attention to Marcial. Marcial was the sort of thing he knew all,71,18
8961,"about. He had come out of retirement to compete with Marcial, knowing it",72,18
8962,was a competition gained in advance. He had expected to compete with,68,18
8963,"Marcial and the other stars of the decadence of bull-fighting, and he",69,18
8964,knew that the sincerity of his own bull-fighting would be so set off by,71,18
8965,the false æsthetics of the bull-fighters of the decadent period that he,71,18
8966,would only have to be in the ring. His return from retirement had been,70,18
8967,"spoiled by Romero. Romero did always, smoothly, calmly, and beautifully,",72,18
8968,"what he, Belmonte, could only bring himself to do now sometimes. The",68,18
8969,"crowd felt it, even the people from Biarritz, even the American",63,18
8970,"ambassador saw it, finally. It was a competition that Belmonte would not",72,18
8971,enter because it would lead only to a bad horn wound or death. Belmonte,71,18
8972,was no longer well enough. He no longer had his greatest moments in the,71,18
8973,bull-ring. He was not sure that there were any great moments. Things,68,18
8974,were not the same and now life only came in flashes. He had flashes of,70,18
8975,"the old greatness with his bulls, but they were not of value because he",71,18
8976,had discounted them in advance when he had picked the bulls out for,67,18
8977,"their safety, getting out of a motor and leaning on a fence, looking",68,18
8978,over at the herd on the ranch of his friend the bull-breeder. So he had,71,18
8979,"two small, manageable bulls without much horns, and when he felt the",68,18
8980,"greatness again coming, just a little of it through the pain that was",69,18
8981,"always with him, it had been discounted and sold in advance, and it did",71,18
8982,"not give him a good feeling. It was the greatness, but it did not make",70,18
8983,bull-fighting wonderful to him any more.,40,18
8984,,0,18
8985,"Pedro Romero had the greatness. He loved bull-fighting, and I think he",70,18
8986,"loved the bulls, and I think he loved Brett. Everything of which he",67,18
8987,could control the locality he did in front of her all that afternoon.,69,18
8988,"Never once did he look up. He made it stronger that way, and did it for",71,18
8989,"himself, too, as well as for her. Because he did not look up to ask if",70,18
8990,"it pleased he did it all for himself inside, and it strengthened him,",69,18
8991,"and yet he did it for her, too. But he did not do it for her at any loss",72,18
8992,to himself. He gained by it all through the afternoon.,54,18
8993,,0,18
8994,His first “quite” was directly below us. The three matadors take the,68,18
8995,bull in turn after each charge he makes at a picador. Belmonte was the,70,18
8996,first. Marcial was the second. Then came Romero. The three of them were,71,18
8997,"standing at the left of the horse. The picador, his hat down over his",69,18
8998,"eyes, the shaft of his pic angling sharply toward the bull, kicked in",69,18
8999,the spurs and held them and with the reins in his left hand walked the,70,18
9000,horse forward toward the bull. The bull was watching. Seemingly he,66,18
9001,"watched the white horse, but really he watched the triangular steel",67,18
9002,"point of the pic. Romero, watching, saw the bull start to turn his head.",72,18
9003,He did not want to charge. Romero flicked his cape so the color caught,70,18
9004,"the bull’s eye. The bull charged with the reflex, charged, and found not",72,18
9005,"the flash of color but a white horse, and a man leaned far over the",67,18
9006,"horse, shot the steel point of the long hickory shaft into the hump of",70,18
9007,"muscle on the bull’s shoulder, and pulled his horse sideways as he",66,18
9008,"pivoted on the pic, making a wound, enforcing the iron into the bull’s",70,18
9009,"shoulder, making him bleed for Belmonte.",40,18
9010,,0,18
9011,The bull did not insist under the iron. He did not really want to get at,72,18
9012,the horse. He turned and the group broke apart and Romero was taking him,72,18
9013,"out with his cape. He took him out softly and smoothly, and then stopped",72,18
9014,"and, standing squarely in front of the bull, offered him the cape. The",70,18
9015,"bull’s tail went up and he charged, and Romero moved his arms ahead of",70,18
9016,"the bull, wheeling, his feet firmed. The dampened, mud-weighted cape",68,18
9017,"swung open and full as a sail fills, and Romero pivoted with it just",68,18
9018,ahead of the bull. At the end of the pass they were facing each other,69,18
9019,"again. Romero smiled. The bull wanted it again, and Romero’s cape filled",72,18
9020,"again, this time on the other side. Each time he let the bull pass so",69,18
9021,close that the man and the bull and the cape that filled and pivoted,68,18
9022,ahead of the bull were all one sharply etched mass. It was all so slow,70,18
9023,and so controlled. It was as though he were rocking the bull to sleep.,70,18
9024,"He made four veronicas like that, and finished with a half-veronica that",72,18
9025,"turned his back on the bull and came away toward the applause, his hand",71,18
9026,"on his hip, his cape on his arm, and the bull watching his back going",69,18
9027,away.,5,18
9028,,0,18
9029,In his own bulls he was perfect. His first bull did not see well. After,71,18
9030,the first two passes with the cape Romero knew exactly how bad the,66,18
9031,vision was impaired. He worked accordingly. It was not brilliant,64,18
9032,bull-fighting. It was only perfect bull-fighting. The crowd wanted the,70,18
9033,bull changed. They made a great row. Nothing very fine could happen with,72,18
9034,"a bull that could not see the lures, but the President would not order",70,18
9035,him replaced.,13,18
9036,,0,18
9037,“Why don’t they change him?” Brett asked.,41,18

9045,“It’s the sort of thing I don’t like to see.”,45,18
9046,,0,18
9047,It was not nice to watch if you cared anything about the person who was,71,18
9048,"doing it. With the bull who could not see the colors of the capes, or",69,18
9049,"the scarlet flannel of the muleta, Romero had to make the bull consent",70,18
9050,"with his body. He had to get so close that the bull saw his body, and",69,18
9051,"would start for it, and then shift the bull’s charge to the flannel and",71,18
9052,finish out the pass in the classic manner. The Biarritz crowd did not,69,18
9053,"like it They thought Romero was afraid, and that was why he gave that",69,18
9054,little sidestep each time as he transferred the bull’s charge from his,70,18
9055,own body to the flannel. They preferred Belmonte’s imitation of himself,71,18
9056,or Marcial’s imitation of Belmonte. There were three of them in the row,71,18

9071,"dully, then so close that the bull thought he had him, offering again",69,18
9072,"and finally drawing the charge and then, just before the horns came,",68,18
9073,"giving the bull the red cloth to follow with at little, almost",62,18

9108,him to drink out of the jug. He did not look up at us.,54,18
9109,,0,18
9110,Marcial had a big day. They were still applauding him when Romero’s last,72,18

9112,in the morning running.,23,18
9113,,0,18
9114,During Romero’s first bull his hurt face had been very noticeable.,66,18

9116,delicate working with the bull that could not see well brought it out.,70,18
9117,The fight with Cohn had not touched his spirit but his face had been,68,18
9118,smashed and his body hurt. He was wiping all that out now. Each thing,69,18
9119,that he did with this bull wiped that out a little cleaner. It was a,68,18
9120,"good bull, a big bull, and with horns, and it turned and recharged",66,18

9123,"When he had finished his work with the muleta and was ready to kill, the",72,18
9124,"crowd made him go on. They did not want the bull killed yet, they did",69,18
9125,not want it to be over. Romero went on. It was like a course in,63,18
9126,"bull-fighting. All the passes he linked up, all completed, all slow,",68,18
9127,templed and smooth. There were no tricks and no mystifications. There,69,18
9128,was no brusqueness. And each pass as it reached the summit gave you a,69,18
9129,sudden ache inside. The crowd did not want it ever to be finished.,66,18

9131,"The bull was squared on all four feet to be killed, and Romero killed",69,18

9134,drew the sword out of the folds of the muleta and sighted along the,67,18

9167,"Several boys shouted at Brett. The crowd was the boys, the dancers, and",71,18
9168,the drunks. Romero turned and tried to get through the crowd. They were,71,18
9169,all around him trying to lift him and put him on their shoulders. He,68,18
9170,"fought and twisted away, and started running, in the midst of them,",67,18
9171,toward the exit. He did not want to be carried on people’s shoulders.,69,18
9172,But they held him and lifted him. It was uncomfortable and his legs were,72,18
9173,spraddled and his body was very sore. They were lifting him and all,67,18
9174,running toward the gate. He had his hand on somebody’s shoulder. He,67,18

9182,Belmonte ate very little. They were leaving on the seven o’clock train,70,18

9325,went sailing off and I sat up in bed and looked at the wall to make it,70,18
9326,stop. Outside in the square the fiesta was going on. It did not mean,68,18
9327,anything. Later Bill and Mike came in to get me to go down and eat with,71,18

9358,In the morning it was all over. The fiesta was finished. I woke about,69,19
9359,"nine o’clock, had a bath, dressed, and went down-stairs. The square was",71,19
9360,empty and there were no people on the streets. A few children were,66,19
9361,picking up rocket-sticks in the square. The cafés were just opening and,71,19
9362,the waiters were carrying out the comfortable white wicker chairs and,69,19
9363,arranging them around the marble-topped tables in the shade of the,66,19
9364,arcade. They were sweeping the streets and sprinkling them with a hose.,71,19
9365,,0,19
9366,I sat in one of the wicker chairs and leaned back comfortably. The,66,19
9367,waiter was in no hurry to come. The white-paper announcements of the,68,19
9368,unloading of the bulls and the big schedules of special trains were,67,19
9369,still up on the pillars of the arcade. A waiter wearing a blue apron,68,19
9370,"came out with a bucket of water and a cloth, and commenced to tear down",71,19
9371,"the notices, pulling the paper off in strips and washing and rubbing",68,19
9372,away the paper that stuck to the stone. The fiesta was over.,60,19
9373,,0,19
9374,I drank a coffee and after a while Bill came over. I watched him come,69,19

9400,We had lunch and paid the bill. Montoya did not come near us. One of the,72,19
9401,maids brought the bill. The car was outside. The chauffeur piled and,68,19
9402,strapped the bags on top of the car and put them in beside him in the,69,19
9403,"front seat and we got in. The car went out of the square, along through",71,19
9404,"the side streets, out under the trees and down the hill and away from",69,19
9405,Pamplona. It did not seem like a very long ride. Mike had a bottle of,69,19
9406,Fundador. I only took a couple of drinks. We came over the mountains and,72,19
9407,"out of Spain and down the white roads and through the overfoliaged, wet,",72,19
9408,"green, Basque country, and finally into Bayonne. We left Bill’s baggage",71,19
9409,"at the station, and he bought a ticket to Paris. His train left at",66,19

9428,“Let’s roll for it.”,20,19

9430,So we rolled poker dice out of a deep leather dice-cup. Bill was out,68,19
9431,first roll. Mike lost to me and handed the bartender a hundred-franc,68,19
9432,note. The whiskeys were twelve francs apiece. We had another round and,70,19
9433,Mike lost again. Each time he gave the bartender a good tip. In a room,70,19
9434,off the bar there was a good jazz band playing. It was a pleasant bar.,70,19
9435,We had another round. I went out on the first roll with four kings. Bill,72,19
9436,and Mike rolled. Mike won the first roll with four jacks. Bill won the,70,19
9437,second. On the final roll Mike had three kings and let them stay. He,68,19
9438,"handed the dice-cup to Bill. Bill rattled them and rolled, and there",68,19
9439,"were three kings, an ace, and a queen.",38,19

9497,"“Anywhere you’d like to go, Mike?” Bill asked.",46,19

9509,"the white, red-roofed villas, patches of forest, and the ocean very blue",72,19
9510,with the tide out and the water curling far out along the beach. We,67,19
9511,drove through Saint Jean de Luz and passed through villages farther down,72,19
9512,the coast. Back of the rolling country we were going through we saw the,71,19
9513,mountains we had come over from Pamplona. The road went on ahead. Bill,70,19
9514,looked at his watch. It was time for us to go back. He knocked on the,69,19
9515,glass and told the driver to turn around. The driver backed the car out,71,19
9516,"into the grass to turn it. In back of us were the woods, below a stretch",72,19
9517,"of meadow, then the sea.",24,19
9518,,0,19
9519,At the hotel where Mike was going to stay in Saint Jean we stopped the,70,19

9536,We all shook hands. We waved from the car to Mike. He stood in the road,71,19
9537,watching. We got to Bayonne just before the train left. A porter carried,72,19
9538,Bill’s bags in from the consigne. I went as far as the inner gate to the,72,19
9539,tracks.,7,19

9553,He went in through the gate to the train. The porter went ahead with the,72,19

9556,I went outside to the car.,26,19
9557,,0,19
9558,“How much do we owe you?” I asked the driver. The price to Bayonne had,70,19
9559,been fixed at a hundred and fifty pesetas.,42,19

9561,“Two hundred pesetas.”,22,19

9563,“How much more will it be if you drive me to San Sebastian on your way,70,19

9567,,0,19
9568,“Don’t kid me.”,15,19
9569,,0,19
9570,“Thirty-five pesetas.”,22,19

9572,"“It’s not worth it,” I said. “Drive me to the Hotel Panier Fleuri.”",67,19
9573,,0,19
9574,At the hotel I paid the driver and gave him a tip. The car was powdered,71,19
9575,with dust. I rubbed the rod-case through the dust. It seemed the last,69,19
9576,thing that connected me with Spain and the fiesta. The driver put the,69,19
9577,car in gear and went down the street. I watched it turn off to take the,71,19
9578,road to Spain. I went into the hotel and they gave me a room. It was the,72,19
9579,same room I had slept in when Bill and Cohn and I were in Bayonne. That,71,19
9580,"seemed a very long time ago. I washed, changed my shirt, and went out in",72,19
9581,the town.,9,19
9582,,0,19
9583,At a newspaper kiosque I bought a copy of the New York _Herald_ and sat,71,19
9584,in a café to read it. It felt strange to be in France again. There was a,72,19
9585,"safe, suburban feeling. I wished I had gone up to Paris with Bill,",66,19
9586,except that Paris would have meant more fiesta-ing. I was through with,70,19
9587,fiestas for a while. It would be quiet in San Sebastian. The season does,72,19
9588,not open there until August. I could get a good hotel room and read and,71,19
9589,swim. There was a fine beach there. There were wonderful trees along the,72,19
9590,"promenade above the beach, and there were many children sent down with",70,19
9591,their nurses before the season opened. In the evening there would be,68,19
9592,band concerts under the trees across from the Café Marinas. I could sit,71,19
9593,in the Marinas and listen.,26,19
9594,,0,19
9595,“How does one eat inside?” I asked the waiter. Inside the café was a,68,19
9596,restaurant.,11,19
9597,,0,19
9598,“Well. Very well. One eats very well.”,38,19
9599,,0,19
9600,“Good.”,7,19
9601,,0,19
9602,I went in and ate dinner. It was a big meal for France but it seemed,68,19
9603,very carefully apportioned after Spain. I drank a bottle of wine for,68,19
9604,company. It was a Château Margaux. It was pleasant to be drinking slowly,72,19
9605,and to be tasting the wine and to be drinking alone. A bottle of wine,69,19
9606,was good company. Afterward I had coffee. The waiter recommended a,66,19
9607,Basque liqueur called Izzarra. He brought in the bottle and poured a,68,19
9608,liqueur-glass full. He said Izzarra was made of the flowers of the,66,19
9609,Pyrenees. The veritable flowers of the Pyrenees. It looked like hair-oil,72,19
9610,and smelled like Italian _strega_. I told him to take the flowers of the,72,19
9611,Pyrenees away and bring me a _vieux marc_. The _marc_ was good. I had a,71,19
9612,second _marc_ after the coffee.,31,19
9613,,0,19
9614,"The waiter seemed a little offended about the flowers of the Pyrenees,",70,19
9615,so I overtipped him. That made him happy. It felt comfortable to be in a,72,19
9616,country where it is so simple to make people happy. You can never tell,70,19
9617,whether a Spanish waiter will thank you. Everything is on such a clear,70,19
9618,financial basis in France. It is the simplest country to live in. No one,72,19
9619,makes things complicated by becoming your friend for any obscure reason.,72,19
9620,If you want people to like you you have only to spend a little money. I,71,19
9621,spent a little money and the waiter liked me. He appreciated my valuable,72,19
9622,qualities. He would be glad to see me back. I would dine there again,68,19
9623,"some time and he would be glad to see me, and would want me at his",66,19
9624,table. It would be a sincere liking because it would have a sound basis.,72,19
9625,I was back in France.,21,19
9626,,0,19
9627,Next morning I tipped every one a little too much at the hotel to make,70,19
9628,"more friends, and left on the morning train for San Sebastian. At the",69,19
9629,station I did not tip the porter more than I should because I did not,69,19
9630,think I would ever see him again. I only wanted a few good French,65,19
9631,friends in Bayonne to make me welcome in case I should come back there,70,19
9632,again. I knew that if they remembered me their friendship would be,66,19
9633,loyal.,6,19
9634,,0,19
9635,At Irun we had to change trains and show passports. I hated to leave,68,19
9636,France. Life was so simple in France. I felt I was a fool to be going,69,19
9637,back into Spain. In Spain you could not tell about anything. I felt like,72,19
9638,"a fool to be going back into it, but I stood in line with my passport,",70,19
9639,"opened my bags for the customs, bought a ticket, went through a gate,",69,19
9640,"climbed onto the train, and after forty minutes and eight tunnels I was",71,19
9641,at San Sebastian.,17,19
9642,,0,19
9643,Even on a hot day San Sebastian has a certain early-morning quality. The,72,19
9644,trees seem as though their leaves were never quite dry. The streets feel,72,19
9645,as though they had just been sprinkled. It is always cool and shady on,70,19
9646,certain streets on the hottest day. I went to a hotel in the town where,71,19
9647,"I had stopped before, and they gave me a room with a balcony that opened",72,19
9648,out above the roofs of the town. There was a green mountainside beyond,70,19
9649,the roofs.,10,19
9650,,0,19
9651,I unpacked my bags and stacked my books on the table beside the head of,71,19
9652,"the bed, put out my shaving things, hung up some clothes in the big",67,19
9653,"armoire, and made up a bundle for the laundry. Then I took a shower in",70,19
9654,the bathroom and went down to lunch. Spain had not changed to,61,19
9655,"summer-time, so I was early. I set my watch again. I had recovered an",69,19
9656,hour by coming to San Sebastian.,32,19
9657,,0,19
9658,As I went into the dining-room the concierge brought me a police,64,19
9659,"bulletin to fill out. I signed it and asked him for two telegraph forms,",72,19
9660,"and wrote a message to the Hotel Montoya, telling them to forward all",69,19
9661,mail and telegrams for me to this address. I calculated how many days I,71,19
9662,would be in San Sebastian and then wrote out a wire to the office asking,72,19
9663,"them to hold mail, but forward all wires for me to San Sebastian for six",72,19
9664,days. Then I went in and had lunch.,35,19
9665,,0,19
9666,"After lunch I went up to my room, read a while, and went to sleep. When",71,19
9667,"I woke it was half past four. I found my swimming-suit, wrapped it with",71,19
9668,"a comb in a towel, and went down-stairs and walked up the street to the",71,19
9669,"Concha. The tide was about half-way out. The beach was smooth and firm,",71,19
9670,"and the sand yellow. I went into a bathing-cabin, undressed, put on my",70,19
9671,"suit, and walked across the smooth sand to the sea. The sand was warm",69,19
9672,under bare feet. There were quite a few people in the water and on the,70,19
9673,beach. Out beyond where the headlands of the Concha almost met to form,70,19
9674,the harbor there was a white line of breakers and the open sea. Although,72,19
9675,"the tide was going out, there were a few slow rollers. They came in like",72,19
9676,"undulations in the water, gathered weight of water, and then broke",66,19
9677,smoothly on the warm sand. I waded out. The water was cold. As a roller,71,19
9678,"came I dove, swam out under water, and came to the surface with all the",71,19
9679,"chill gone. I swam out to the raft, pulled myself up, and lay on the hot",72,19
9680,planks. A boy and girl were at the other end. The girl had undone the,69,19
9681,top strap of her bathing-suit and was browning her back. The boy lay,68,19
9682,face downward on the raft and talked to her. She laughed at things he,69,19
9683,"said, and turned her brown back in the sun. I lay on the raft in the sun",72,19
9684,"until I was dry. Then I tried several dives. I dove deep once, swimming",71,19
9685,down to the bottom. I swam with my eyes open and it was green and dark.,71,19
9686,"The raft made a dark shadow. I came out of water beside the raft, pulled",72,19
9687,"up, dove once more, holding it for length, and then swam ashore. I lay",70,19
9688,"on the beach until I was dry, then went into the bathing-cabin, took off",72,19
9689,"my suit, sloshed myself with fresh water, and rubbed dry.",57,19
9690,,0,19
9691,"I walked around the harbor under the trees to the casino, and then up",69,19
9692,one of the cool streets to the Café Marinas. There was an orchestra,67,19
9693,playing inside the café and I sat out on the terrace and enjoyed the,68,19
9694,"fresh coolness in the hot day, and had a glass of lemon-juice and shaved",72,19
9695,ice and then a long whiskey and soda. I sat in front of the Marinas for,71,19
9696,"a long time and read and watched the people, and listened to the music.",71,19
9697,,0,19
9698,"Later when it began to get dark, I walked around the harbor and out",67,19
9699,"along the promenade, and finally back to the hotel for supper. There was",72,19
9700,"a bicycle-race on, the Tour du Pays Basque, and the riders were stopping",72,19
9701,"that night in San Sebastian. In the dining-room, at one side, there was",71,19
9702,"a long table of bicycle-riders, eating with their trainers and managers.",72,19
9703,"They were all French and Belgians, and paid close attention to their",68,19
9704,"meal, but they were having a good time. At the head of the table were",69,19
9705,"two good-looking French girls, with much Rue du Faubourg Montmartre",67,19
9706,chic. I could not make out whom they belonged to. They all spoke in,67,19
9707,slang at the long table and there were many private jokes and some jokes,72,19
9708,at the far end that were not repeated when the girls asked to hear them.,72,19
9709,"The next morning at five o’clock the race resumed with the last lap, San",72,19
9710,"Sebastian-Bilbao. The bicycle-riders drank much wine, and were burned",69,19
9711,and browned by the sun. They did not take the race seriously except,67,19
9712,among themselves. They had raced among themselves so often that it did,70,19
9713,not make much difference who won. Especially in a foreign country. The,70,19
9714,money could be arranged.,24,19
9715,,0,19
9716,The man who had a matter of two minutes lead in the race had an attack,70,19
9717,"of boils, which were very painful. He sat on the small of his back. His",71,19
9718,neck was very red and the blond hairs were sunburned. The other riders,70,19
9719,joked him about his boils. He tapped on the table with his fork.,64,19
9720,,0,19
9721,"“Listen,” he said, “to-morrow my nose is so tight on the handle-bars",68,19
9722,that the only thing touches those boils is a lovely breeze.”,60,19
9723,,0,19
9724,"One of the girls looked at him down the table, and he grinned and turned",72,19
9725,"red. The Spaniards, they said, did not know how to pedal.",57,19
9726,,0,19
9727,I had coffee out on the terrasse with the team manager of one of the big,72,19
9728,"bicycle manufacturers. He said it had been a very pleasant race, and",68,19
9729,would have been worth watching if Bottechia had not abandoned it at,67,19
9730,"Pamplona. The dust had been bad, but in Spain the roads were better than",72,19
9731,"in France. Bicycle road-racing was the only sport in the world, he said.",72,19
9732,Had I ever followed the Tour de France? Only in the papers. The Tour de,71,19
9733,France was the greatest sporting event in the world. Following and,66,19
9734,organizing the road races had made him know France. Few people know,67,19
9735,France. All spring and all summer and all fall he spent on the road with,72,19
9736,bicycle road-racers. Look at the number of motor-cars now that followed,71,19
9737,the riders from town to town in a road race. It was a rich country and,70,19
9738,more _sportif_ every year. It would be the most _sportif_ country in the,72,19
9739,world. It was bicycle road-racing did it. That and football. He knew,68,19
9740,France. _La France Sportive._ He knew road-racing. We had a cognac.,67,19
9741,"After all, though, it wasn’t bad to get back to Paris. There is only one",72,19
9742,"Paname. In all the world, that is. Paris is the town the most _sportif_",71,19
9743,in the world. Did I know the _Chope de Negre_? Did I not. I would see,69,19
9744,him there some time. I certainly would. We would drink another _fine_,69,19
9745,together. We certainly would. They started at six o’clock less a quarter,72,19
9746,in the morning. Would I be up for the depart? I would certainly try to.,71,19
9747,Would I like him to call me? It was very interesting. I would leave a,69,19
9748,call at the desk. He would not mind calling me. I could not let him take,72,19
9749,the trouble. I would leave a call at the desk. We said good-bye until,69,19
9750,the next morning.,17,19
9751,,0,19
9752,In the morning when I awoke the bicycle-riders and their following cars,71,19
9753,had been on the road for three hours. I had coffee and the papers in bed,72,19
9754,and then dressed and took my bathing-suit down to the beach. Everything,71,19
9755,was fresh and cool and damp in the early morning. Nurses in uniform and,71,19
9756,in peasant costume walked under the trees with children. The Spanish,68,19
9757,children were beautiful. Some bootblacks sat together under a tree,66,19
9758,talking to a soldier. The soldier had only one arm. The tide was in and,71,19
9759,there was a good breeze and a surf on the beach.,48,19
9760,,0,19
9761,"I undressed in one of the bath-cabins, crossed the narrow line of beach",71,19
9762,"and went into the water. I swam out, trying to swim through the rollers,",72,19
9763,but having to dive sometimes. Then in the quiet water I turned and,66,19
9764,"floated. Floating I saw only the sky, and felt the drop and lift of the",71,19
9765,"swells. I swam back to the surf and coasted in, face down, on a big",67,19
9766,"roller, then turned and swam, trying to keep in the trough and not have",71,19
9767,"a wave break over me. It made me tired, swimming in the trough, and I",69,19
9768,turned and swam out to the raft. The water was buoyant and cold. It felt,72,19
9769,"as though you could never sink. I swam slowly, it seemed like a long",68,19
9770,"swim with the high tide, and then pulled up on the raft and sat,",64,19
9771,"dripping, on the boards that were becoming hot in the sun. I looked",67,19
9772,"around at the bay, the old town, the casino, the line of trees along the",72,19
9773,"promenade, and the big hotels with their white porches and gold-lettered",72,19
9774,"names. Off on the right, almost closing the harbor, was a green hill",68,19
9775,with a castle. The raft rocked with the motion of the water. On the,67,19
9776,other side of the narrow gap that led into the open sea was another high,72,19
9777,headland. I thought I would like to swim across the bay but I was afraid,72,19
9778,of cramp.,9,19
9779,,0,19
9780,I sat in the sun and watched the bathers on the beach. They looked very,71,19
9781,"small. After a while I stood up, gripped with my toes on the edge of the",72,19
9782,"raft as it tipped with my weight, and dove cleanly and deeply, to come",70,19
9783,"up through the lightening water, blew the salt water out of my head, and",72,19
9784,swam slowly and steadily in to shore.,37,19
9785,,0,19
9786,"After I was dressed and had paid for the bath-cabin, I walked back to",69,19
9787,the hotel. The bicycle-racers had left several copies of _L’Auto_,65,19
9788,"around, and I gathered them up in the reading-room and took them out and",72,19
9789,sat in an easy chair in the sun to read about and catch up on French,68,19
9790,sporting life. While I was sitting there the concierge came out with a,70,19
9791,blue envelope in his hand.,26,19

9844,I did not sleep much that night on the Sud Express. In the morning I had,72,19
9845,breakfast in the dining-car and watched the rock and pine country,65,19
9846,"between Avila and Escorial. I saw the Escorial out of the window, gray",70,19
9847,"and long and cold in the sun, and did not give a damn about it. I saw",69,19
9848,"Madrid come up over the plain, a compact white sky-line on the top of a",71,19
9849,little cliff away off across the sun-hardened country.,54,19
9850,,0,19
9851,The Norte station in Madrid is the end of the line. All trains finish,69,19
9852,there. They don’t go on anywhere. Outside were cabs and taxis and a line,72,19
9853,of hotel runners. It was like a country town. I took a taxi and we,66,19
9854,"climbed up through the gardens, by the empty palace and the unfinished",70,19
9855,"church on the edge of the cliff, and on up until we were in the high,",69,19
9856,"hot, modern town. The taxi coasted down a smooth street to the Puerta",69,19
9857,"del Sol, and then through the traffic and out into the Carrera San",66,19
9858,Jeronimo. All the shops had their awnings down against the heat. The,68,19
9859,windows on the sunny side of the street were shuttered. The taxi stopped,72,19
9860,at the curb. I saw the sign HOTEL MONTANA on the second floor. The,66,19
9861,taxi-driver carried the bags in and left them by the elevator. I could,70,19
9862,"not make the elevator work, so I walked up. On the second floor up was a",72,19
9863,cut brass sign: HOTEL MONTANA. I rang and no one came to the door. I,68,19
9864,rang again and a maid with a sullen face opened the door.,57,19
